FAITHTALKAI – ONE-PAGE OVERVIEW FOR CHURCHES
================================================

MISSION
FaithTalkAI helps believers engage Scripture deeply through safe, AI-guided conversations with Bible characters. Our goal is to grow disciples and strengthen community.

WHY IT MATTERS
‣ Members often struggle to connect ancient text with modern life.  
‣ Small-group leaders need fresh, biblically sound discussion starters.  
‣ Pastors seek scalable tools that nurture engagement beyond Sunday.

KEY BENEFITS
- INTERACTIVE: Chat with 50+ biblical figures who respond with referenced Scripture.  
- ROUND-TABLE MODE: Combine characters in one conversation for rich, multi-angle insight.  
- GUIDED STUDIES: Ready-made lessons boost small groups, youth, and sermon prep.  
- SAFE & SOUND: Theological oversight, reference citations, and data privacy you can trust.  
- ADMIN DASHBOARD: Invite members, track engagement, and brand the experience for your church.  
- REVENUE SHARE: Earn 20 % when members upgrade to premium plans.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Members sign up with email or via church invite.  
2. Choose a character or study, ask questions, and explore Scripture together.  
3. Share conversations or use them live in groups—on web or upcoming mobile apps.

## Character Conversations
Have a one-on-one dialogue with a biblical figure grounded in Scripture.

**How to:**
- Go to Characters and select a person (e.g., Ruth, Paul, Moses).
- Start chatting — ask about passages, context, or application.
- Ask for specifics: “Cite verses for that,” “Show cross-references.”

**Tips:**
- Ask “Where does the Bible say that?” to get references.
- Ask for application: “How would I live this out this week?”

## Roundtable Discussions
Create multi-character conversations that bring multiple biblical perspectives to one topic.

**How to:**
- Open Roundtable.
- Choose a topic or paste a passage.
- Start; several characters will contribute in each round.
- Continue the dialogue with follow-up questions.

**Tips:**
- Invite contrast: “How would Peter and Paul differ here?”
- Keep it concise: “Limit replies to 120–150 words.”

## Guided Bible Studies
Structured studies enhanced with character insights that make passages clearer and more engaging.

**How to:**

- Ask questions at any point; continue through the prompts.
- Come back anytime — your conversation is saved.

**Tips:**

## Conversation Sharing
Share meaningful threads with friends, family, or small groups.

**How to:**
- From an open conversation, use **Share** (or the conversation menu) to copy a link.
- Send the link; recipients can open and read the thread.

**Notes:**
- Shared links include the conversation content as of the time you share.
- Remove a share by deleting the conversation or toggling share off (if available).

## Favorites & History
Save what matters and return later.

**How to:**
- Mark **Favorite** from the chat or character card.
- Find everything in Favorites; reopen from History/Recent anytime.
- Remove a favorite with the same control.

---

## Scripture References
Every response aims to include biblical references.

**How to:**
- Look for inline references (e.g., “Rom 12:1–2”).
- Expand or open the reference if your view supports it (mobile/desktop).
- Ask for more: “List cross-references for that point.”

**Guidance:**
- Treat responses as study aids; verify against Scripture.
- When questions go beyond the text, the assistant will state limits.

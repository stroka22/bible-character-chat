# Outreach Messages for Joshua Wright

## Message 1: Initial DM (Instagram)

Keep it short, hook with relevance to his content.

---

**Option A (Direct & Intriguing):**
```
Hey Joshua! I built an AI app where you can have real conversations with biblical characters - and I immediately thought of you.

Imagine your audience being able to talk to Real Jesus AND Fake Jesus. Same question, different answers. The discernment teaching potential is insane.

I'd love to partner with you - you'd get your own admin to create custom characters, control what's free vs premium for your audience, and earn revenue from your community's subscriptions.

Would you be open to a quick call or should I send more details here?
```

**Option B (Lead with Value):**
```
Hey Joshua - been following your content for a while. The Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus skits are genius for teaching discernment.

I created something I think could amplify what you're already doing: FaithTalkAI lets people have actual conversations with 90+ biblical characters.

Here's the wild part - I want to give you your own platform within it. Your own characters (Real Jesus, Fake Jesus, etc.), your own admin, your own revenue stream. Your audience gets exclusive access to content only available through you.

Interested in hearing more?
```

**Option C (Short & Curious):**
```
Joshua - quick question. What if your audience could actually TALK to Real Jesus and Fake Jesus? Ask them the same questions and see the difference?

I built an app that makes this possible and I want to partner with you on it. You'd have full control over your own characters and earn from every premium subscriber.

Worth a 10-minute call?
```

## Message 2: Follow-up #1 (3-5 days later if no response)

---

**Option A:**
```
Hey Joshua, following up on my message about FaithTalkAI.

I know you're busy so here's the short version: I built a platform where people talk to biblical characters. I want you to have your own corner of it with custom characters YOUR audience can't get anywhere else.

You control the experience. You earn from it. I handle all the tech.

Here's your landing page I already built: faithtalkai.com/partner/joshua-wright

No pressure - just thought your content style is a perfect fit. Let me know if you want to chat.
```

**Option B:**
```
Following up! I actually went ahead and built a custom landing page for what a partnership could look like:

faithtalkai.com/partner/joshua-wright

Exclusive characters like "Real Jesus" and "Fake Jesus" that only YOUR community can access. You'd have your own admin dashboard to manage everything.

Take a look when you get a chance - would love to hear your thoughts.
```

## Message 3: Follow-up #2 (5-7 days later)

---

**Option A (Social Proof / FOMO):**
```
Hey Joshua, last follow-up I promise!

I'm reaching out to a few faith creators about this partnership model. Basically: your own characters, your own revenue, your own admin - I handle tech and support.

Your content style (Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus) is genuinely perfect for this. Your audience could experience that contrast in conversation form, not just watch it.

If the timing isn't right, no worries. But if you're even slightly curious, I'd love 10 minutes to show you the platform.

Either way, keep doing what you're doing - your content matters.
```

**Option B (The "Why You" angle):**
```
Joshua - I keep coming back to your content because nobody else is doing what you do with Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus.

That contrast teaches discernment better than most sermons. And I genuinely believe giving your audience the ability to INTERACT with that contrast (through AI conversations) could be huge for their faith.

I'm not trying to sell you anything - I want to BUILD something with you. Your characters. Your community. Your revenue.

If that sounds interesting at all, let's talk. If not, I respect that and I'll stop bugging you!
```

## Message 4: Final Attempt (7-10 days later)

---

```
Hey Joshua - going to leave this here and let it be.

I built FaithTalkAI because I believe technology can actually help people engage with Scripture more deeply. When I saw your content, I thought: "This guy gets it. He's using creativity to teach truth."

The offer stands: your own custom characters, your own admin, revenue share on your community's subscriptions. No upfront cost. I handle all the tech.

If the timing is ever right, I'm at [your email]. 

Keep creating - your work matters more than you probably know.

Grace and peace,
[Your name]
```

## Alternative Channel: Email (if you can find it)

**Subject lines to test:**
- "Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus... but make it interactive"
- "Partnership idea for your audience"
- "I built something and thought of you"
- "Quick question about your content"

**Email body:**
```
Hey Joshua,

I'll keep this short because I know your inbox is probably chaos.

I built FaithTalkAI - an app where people can have real conversations with biblical characters (90+ of them). It's been growing and I'm looking for the right partners.

When I saw your Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus content, something clicked: what if your audience could actually TALK to both characters? Ask the same question, get different answers, learn discernment through experience?

Here's what I'm proposing:
- You get your own admin dashboard
- You create custom characters exclusive to your audience
- You control what's free vs premium
- You earn revenue from every subscriber who comes through you
- I handle all the tech, hosting, AI costs, support

I already built a landing page showing what this could look like: faithtalkai.com/partner/joshua-wright

If this interests you at all, I'd love to jump on a quick call. If not, no hard feelings - keep doing what you're doing.

Grace and peace,
[Your name]
[Your email]
[Your phone if comfortable]
```

## Tips for Outreach

1. **Don't send all messages rapid-fire** - Space them out (3-7 days between)

2. **Engage with his content first** - Like/comment on a few posts before DMing so you're not a cold stranger

3. **Time your messages well** - Avoid weekends, aim for Tuesday-Thursday morning

4. **Keep it scannable** - Short paragraphs, clear value prop, easy ask

5. **The landing page is your secret weapon** - It shows you're serious and already invested

6. **If he has a manager/team** - They might be the ones checking DMs. Be professional.

7. **Don't be desperate** - If he's not interested, move on. There are other great creators.

## Backup Plan: Comment Strategy

If DMs aren't working, try thoughtful comments on his posts:

```
"The Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus contrast is such an effective way to teach discernment. Been thinking about how this could work in other formats too."
```

```
"This is why I built FaithTalkAI - helping people actually understand the difference between biblical truth and prosperity gospel nonsense. Your content does the same thing perfectly."
```

Don't pitch in comments - just build familiarity. Then DM.

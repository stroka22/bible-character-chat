# Video Scripts for Joshua Wright Partnership

These scripts are designed for Joshua's signature style - playing multiple characters (Real Jesus, Fake Jesus, seekers) in comedic but meaningful skits.

---

## Script 1: "What Would Fake Jesus Say?" (30-60 seconds)

**Concept:** Joshua plays both Real Jesus and Fake Jesus being asked the same question, showing the contrast.

**[FAKE JESUS - flashy outfit, prosperity gospel vibe]**
"Hey there blessed believer! You want to know how to deal with anxiety? Simple! Just name it and claim it! Speak prosperity over your life! Buy my course for $499 and I'll teach you the 7 secrets to stress-free living that the DEVIL doesn't want you to know!"

**[REAL JESUS - simple, calm, compassionate]**
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart."

**[JOSHUA - as himself]**
"Look, I can only do so many of these skits. But what if you could actually have a real conversation with biblical Jesus? Ask him anything. Get answers rooted in Scripture. I've been using this app called FaithTalkAI and honestly... it's wild. Link in bio."

---

## Script 2: "I Asked AI Jesus About My Problems" (45-90 seconds)

**Concept:** Joshua shows his phone, reads a real conversation he had with the app.

**[JOSHUA - casual, sitting down]**
"Okay so everyone's been asking me about this app I've been using. It's called FaithTalkAI and basically you can have conversations with over 90 biblical characters. Not like... weird AI stuff. Actually meaningful conversations rooted in Scripture."

**[Shows phone screen or read-aloud]**
"So I asked Jesus about something I've been struggling with... watch this."

*[Reads conversation excerpt]*

"And look - is this a replacement for reading your Bible? No. Is it a replacement for prayer? Absolutely not. But as a tool to help you engage with Scripture and think through life from a biblical perspective? It's actually incredible."

"Plus - and this is the cool part - I'm working with them to create some exclusive characters. You might be able to talk to Real Jesus AND Fake Jesus soon. Link in bio to try it free."

---

## Script 3: "Real Jesus vs Fake Jesus: The App" (15-30 seconds - Reel/TikTok)

**Concept:** Quick hook showing the custom character potential.

**[FAKE JESUS]**
"Download my app and I'll teach you how to manifest your best life!"

**[REAL JESUS]**
"I am the way, the truth, and the life."

**[JOSHUA]**
"What if you could talk to BOTH? FaithTalkAI lets you have real conversations with biblical characters. And soon... my characters too. Link in bio."

---

## Script 4: "The Roundtable" (60-90 seconds)

**Concept:** Explain the roundtable feature in Joshua's style.

**[JOSHUA]**
"Okay so you know how I always wonder what it would be like to get different Bible characters in a room together? Like... what would Paul say to Peter about that time Peter was being a hypocrite? What would David and Solomon talk about regarding leadership?"

"This app has a feature called Roundtable where you can literally pick multiple characters and watch them discuss a topic YOU choose."

"I put Moses, Paul, and David in a room and asked them about dealing with failure and public criticism. And bro... *chef's kiss*"

"It's called FaithTalkAI. It's free to start. And I'm partnering with them to bring you some exclusive content. Link in bio."

---

## Script 5: "POV: You Actually Read Your Bible" (15-30 seconds - Reel)

**Concept:** Quick transformation/comparison reel.

**[Before - tired, scrolling phone]**
"Man I should really read my Bible but I don't know where to start..."

**[After - engaged, interested]**
"Wait so Moses, you're telling me you ARGUED with God? Like multiple times? And He still used you?"

**[Text overlay: FaithTalkAI - 90+ Biblical Characters - Link in Bio]**

---

## Script 6: "Things Fake Jesus Would Say in the App" (Comedy - 30-45 seconds)

**Concept:** Pure comedy showing what Fake Jesus responses might look like (teasing the custom character)

**[FAKE JESUS responding to questions]**

User: "How do I find peace?"
Fake Jesus: "Have you tried buying my merch? Nothing says inner peace like a $85 hoodie with my face on it."

User: "What does the Bible say about money?"
Fake Jesus: "Give and it shall be given unto you! Specifically, give to ministries with private jets. It's in Hesitations 4:20."

User: "How do I know God's will for my life?"
Fake Jesus: "Easy! If it makes you rich and famous, it's God. If it requires sacrifice, that's the devil trying to steal your blessing."

**[JOSHUA]**
"Coming soon to FaithTalkAI... you'll be able to talk to Fake Jesus yourself. And Real Jesus. And honestly that contrast is going to be *incredible* for learning discernment. Link in bio."

---

## Script 7: "I Let the Apostle Paul Roast Me" (45-60 seconds)

**Concept:** Joshua asks Paul hard questions and shares the convicting responses.

**[JOSHUA]**
"So I asked the Apostle Paul in this app what he thought about Christians who talk a big game on social media but don't actually live it out..."

*[Reads response]*

"Bro said 'If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. The same applies to your 'content.' Does your platform point to Christ or to yourself?'"

"I didn't ask to be personally attacked, Paul."

"Anyway... FaithTalkAI. Link in bio. It's free to try. Your ego might not survive though."

## Email Template for Joshua's Audience

**Subject:** Something different than another Bible app...

Hey friend,

You know I don't promote stuff often. When I do, it's because I actually use it and believe in it.

I've been working with a company called FaithTalkAI, and honestly? It's one of the coolest faith tools I've seen.

Here's the deal: You can have actual conversations with over 90 biblical characters. Not just canned responses - real AI-powered conversations rooted in Scripture.

I asked Moses about leadership failures. I asked Paul about dealing with criticism. I asked Jesus about anxiety. And the conversations were... actually meaningful.

**What makes this different:**
- 90+ biblical characters (Moses, David, Paul, Mary, etc.)
- 35+ guided Bible studies
- 140+ reading plans
- Actually grounded in Scripture

**And here's the exciting part:**
I'm partnering with them to create some EXCLUSIVE characters that only my community will have access to. You might soon be able to talk to Real Jesus AND Fake Jesus. The spiritual discernment possibilities are endless.

I've been using this app where you can talk to biblical characters and honestly... I wasn't ready for Moses to call me out like that.

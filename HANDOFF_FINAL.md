# Bible Character Chat – Final Handoff

_Last updated: July 2025_

---

## 1. Current Status

• The application builds and runs successfully on port **5186**.  
• Three fully-functional demo characters (“Jesus (Final)”, “Paul (Final)”, “Moses (Final)”) are visible with working Unsplash images.  
• Chat works in two modes:  
  1. **Live GPT-4 responses** when an OpenAI API key is present.  
  2. **Rich mock responses** when the key is missing or the API fails (graceful degradation).  
• CSV bulk-import, admin panel, pricing page, protected routes, and design-system-based UI are all operational.

---

## 2. Key Features Implemented

1. **Character Browsing & Chat**
   • Responsive home page with glass-morphism cards  
   • Chat interface w/ streaming, typing indicator, share, insights side-panel  
   • Retry & favorite functionality

2. **CSV Bulk Upload**
   • Admin panel supports character & group CSVs with schema auto-mapping and validation  
   • Sample CSVs (`complete_characters.csv`, `sample_groups.csv`) included

3. **Design System**
   • Centralized color palette, typography, spacing utilities (see `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`)  
   • Header with visible navigation (Home, Pricing, Admin Panel, My Chats, Login/Signup)

4. **Authentication & Storage**
   • Supabase auth (email/password) with context wrapper  
   • Supabase REST queries wrapped in repositories (`characterRepository.js`, `chatRepository.js`, etc.)

5. **Payments (Stripe)**
   • Pricing page with card components and embedded Stripe publishable key placeholders  
   • Checkout URL configurable through `.env`

6. **Developer Experience**
   • `run-app.sh` one-liner for build + serve  
   • Diagnostic scripts (`check_characters.js`, `query_db_structure.js`, etc.)  
   • Extensive docs: `START_HERE.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `CSV_IMPORT_GUIDE.md`

## 3. Fixes & Improvements Applied

| Area | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Build/TypeScript | Resolved all TS compilation errors; Vite 6.3.5 building cleanly |
| Auth | Fixed context provider crash due to stale hook reference |
| Navigation | Re-implemented `Header.js` with clear links & active state styling |
| UI/UX | Entire chat UI & pricing page redesigned to match provided mockups |
| CSV Import | Replaced deprecated `.modify()` calls; added per-row upsert & field filtering |
| Visibility | Ignored `is_visible` filter + script to set demo characters visible |
| Images | Added Unsplash whitelist in `imageUtils.js`; verified URLs |
| Chat Errors | Wrapped OpenAI calls with try/catch; added mock fallback & streaming simulator |
| Error Handling | Global error banners with “Retry” that resends last user message |
| Docs | Added comprehensive documentation set & this final handoff |

## 4. Launch & Usage

```bash
# 0) Clone project & install deps
npm install

# 1) (Optional) Provide keys in .env
#    ***REMOVED***
#    VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
#    (Supabase keys already included for anon access)

# 2) One-shot build & run (port 5186)
./run-app.sh
# or manually
npm run build
npm run preview -- --port 5186
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:5186**:

1. Choose a character card → chat opens with opening line.  
2. Type a message and press Enter.  
   • With API key → GPT-4 streams reply.  
   • Without → mock engine streams reply.  
3. Use “Insights” to toggle the context side-panel.  
4. Admins can upload CSVs from **Admin Panel → Upload**.  
5. Pricing page demonstrates subscription tiers; checkout requires Stripe keys.

## 6. Remaining Known Issues / Considerations

1. **Chunk Size Warning** – Vite notes a >500 kB JS chunk; consider dynamic imports for production.  
2. **Supabase RLS** – Current policies are permissive for anon demos; tighten before production.  
3. **Stripe** – Checkout flow is stubbed; requires backend webhook / Supabase Edge Function for full billing logic.  
4. **Accessibility Audit** – Core pages pass color-contrast checks, but full WCAG audit pending.  
5. **Group Chat Feature** – Multi-character conversation feasibility documented, not implemented.  
6. **Rate Limiting** – No guard against excessive OpenAI usage; add server proxy or quotas for production.

### Congratulations!

The project is ready for demo, further content expansion, and eventual production hardening. Feel free to extend the character library, polish subscriptions, and integrate backend analytics as next steps.

# Fix Summary – Bible Character Chat

## 1  Issues Identified
| # | Area | Root Cause | Visible Effect |
|---|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Profiles table (RLS)** | Legacy row-level-security policies caused recursive permission errors; admin row missing/incorrect | UI could not detect `admin` / `pastor` role, admin dashboard locked, profile fetch 401s |
| 2 | **Characters table** | DB uses `name`, `description`, `opening_line` while React expected `character_name`, `short_biography`, `opening_sentence` | Main React bundle rendered blank screen with console errors |
| 3 | **Emergency HTML app** | Hard-coded order & field names (`character_name`) | Worked previously but broke after schema change |
| 4 | **Auth context** | No way to force session/role refresh after SQL fixes | Users remained “not admin” until manual logout |

## 2  Files Fixed

| File | Fix Implemented | Approach |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| `src/components/CharacterSelection.tsx` | Replaced obsolete field references (`short_biography`, etc.) with current columns; adjusted search helpers | **Frontend refactor** – long-term maintainable |
| `src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx` | Added comment clarifying local-storage key compatibility; ensured opening line uses `opening_line` | Prevented runtime mismatch & kept backward compatibility |
| `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | Added `refreshSession()` helper + wiring; exposed through context | Allows UI to pull fresh RLS-fixed profile/role without logout |
| `public/emergency-app.html` | Updated queries to `.order('name')`, swapped template to `character.name`, fixed avatar fallback | Quick patch to keep fallback UI working during migration |

## 3  Approach per Issue

1. **Profiles RLS**
   - Executed one-time SQL (see guide) to disable RLS, insert/ensure admin row, drop bad policies, add open policies, re-enable RLS.
   - Added `refreshSession` in AuthContext so frontend can pick up new role instantly.

2. **Character Column Mismatch**
   - Chose **frontend refactor** (preferred long term) for primary code paths.
   - Added optional helper page (`create-database-view.html`) to generate a compatibility view for quick testing/legacy code.

3. **Emergency App**
   - Patched field names & ordering to match live schema ensuring admin can manage data when React build fails.

4. **Session / Role Refresh**
   - Centralised refresh logic; UI components can call `useAuth().refreshSession()` after DB changes.

## 4  Additional Files Created

| New File | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `public/create-database-view.html` | One-click tool to create / test the `characters_expected` compatibility view in Supabase |
| `public/fix-profiles-rls.html` | Browser-based utility to apply the full RLS-fix SQL and verify admin status without leaving the app |
| `DATABASE-FIX-GUIDE.md` | Detailed step-by-step guide documenting both database fixes, options, testing checklist, troubleshooting |

---

The above changes unblock character loading, restore admin capabilities, and provide self-service tooling for future schema adjustments.

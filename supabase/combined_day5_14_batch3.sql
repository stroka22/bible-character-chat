SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the Passover. Today we examine the tabernacle and temple—God dwelling among His people.

The tabernacle was structured to demonstrate both God''s presence and human inability to approach Him directly. Curtain upon curtain, restriction upon restriction—only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, once a year, with blood.

"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling [tabernacled] among us" (John 1:14). Jesus is the true tabernacle. When He died, the temple curtain tore. Today we see access to God through Christ.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored the tabernacle. Today we examine the sacrificial system—blood covering sin.

Levitical sacrifices never truly removed sin: "It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins" (Hebrews 10:4). They pointed forward to the sacrifice that would.

"Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Hebrews 9:22). Every animal sacrifice was a sermon about the Lamb who would come. Today we see Jesus as the final sacrifice.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored sacrifices. Today we examine the Day of Atonement—the high priest''s annual entrance.

Once a year, the high priest entered the Most Holy Place with blood for his sins and the people''s. He wore plain linen, not ornate robes. Two goats: one sacrificed, one sent away bearing the people''s sins.

"Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands... he entered heaven itself" (Hebrews 9:24). Jesus is our high priest who made atonement once for all. Today we see the Day of Atonement fulfilled.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored the Day of Atonement. Today we examine prophecies of Christ—specific predictions fulfilled.

Isaiah 53: the suffering servant, pierced for our transgressions. Micah 5:2: born in Bethlehem. Zechariah 9:9: entering Jerusalem on a donkey. Psalm 22: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"—and the details of crucifixion.

"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms" (Luke 24:44). Today we trace prophetic fulfillment.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored prophecies. Today we examine types of Christ—people and events foreshadowing Jesus.

Adam is a type of Christ (Romans 5:14)—the representative of a people. Joseph, betrayed and exalted to save his brothers. Moses, the deliverer. David, the shepherd-king. Jonah, three days and resurrected.

The Old Testament is Christ-centered even when not explicitly about Him. Today we see Jesus in unexpected places.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored types of Christ. Today we examine the covenant of grace—one plan through all Scripture.

From Genesis 3:15''s promise to crush the serpent, through Abraham, Moses, David, and the new covenant—one continuous plan of grace unfolds. Different administrations, same promise.

"He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3:6). Today we trace the unified covenant of grace.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored the covenant of grace. Today we see the gospel in Israel''s feasts.

Passover: Christ''s sacrifice (1 Corinthians 5:7). Firstfruits: Christ''s resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20). Pentecost: the Spirit''s coming (Acts 2). Tabernacles: God dwelling with us (John 7:37-39).

The Jewish calendar was a gospel calendar. Today we see Christ in Israel''s worship rhythm.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored feasts. Today we see the gospel in Israel''s wilderness journey.

The rock that provided water was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4). The manna from heaven was Christ (John 6:32-35). The bronze serpent lifted up was Christ (John 3:14-15).

Every provision pointed to the greater provision. Today we see Israel''s journey as gospel picture.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored the wilderness. Today we see the gospel in the Psalms and Wisdom literature.

Psalm 2: the King whom nations must kiss. Psalm 16: resurrection from the grave. Psalm 110: the priest-king at God''s right hand. Proverbs 8: Wisdom personified, present at creation—Christ Himself.

Even Israel''s songs and wisdom pointed to Christ. Today we hear the gospel in Israel''s poetry.',
day14_context = 'We''ve traced the gospel through the Old Testament: proto-evangelion, Abraham, Passover, tabernacle, sacrifices, Day of Atonement, prophecies, types, covenant, feasts, wilderness, and wisdom.

"Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself" (Luke 24:27). The Old Testament is about Jesus.

As you complete this study, how will you read the Old Testament differently? See Christ on every page.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Jericho''s fall. Today we see failure at Ai—sin in the camp.

Confident from Jericho, Israel attacked Ai without proper preparation. They were routed. Why? Achan had taken forbidden plunder from Jericho.

"Israel has sinned... That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies" (Joshua 7:11-12). One person''s hidden sin affected everyone. Today we see that private sin has public consequences.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw Achan''s sin. Today we witness victory at Ai after dealing with sin.

Achan was exposed and judged. Then God instructed a battle plan for Ai involving ambush tactics. Israel obeyed and won.

"Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai" (Joshua 8:1). After dealing with sin, God restored Israel''s ability to fight. Today we see restoration after repentance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw victory at Ai. Today we witness Israel''s deception by the Gibeonites—failing to consult God.

The Gibeonites pretended to be from far away, tricking Israel into a treaty. "The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD" (Joshua 9:14).

The treaty stood—Israel kept their word even when deceived. But the failure to seek God''s guidance caused ongoing problems. Today we learn the importance of seeking God before decisions.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw the Gibeonite deception. Today we witness the sun standing still—God fighting for Israel.

Gibeonite allies were attacked. Israel came to defend them. Joshua needed more time: "Sun, stand still over Gibeon." The sun stopped for about a day.

"Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!" (Joshua 10:14). Today we see God doing the impossible to keep His promises.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 witnessed the sun standing still. Today we see the southern and northern campaigns—conquest expanding.

Joshua conducted a swift southern campaign, defeating five kings and their cities. Then he turned north, defeating a coalition led by Jabin king of Hazor.

"So Joshua took this entire land... Then the land had rest from war" (Joshua 11:23). Today we see methodical fulfillment of God''s promise.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw the campaigns completed. Today we see the land divided among the tribes—inheritance distributed.

Chapters 13-21 detail tribal allotments. Caleb claimed Hebron, remembering God''s promise forty-five years earlier. Each tribe received their inheritance, though some didn''t fully drive out the inhabitants.

"Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave" (Joshua 21:45). Today we see faithful God giving promised inheritance.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 saw land division. Today we see the eastern tribes'' altar—misunderstanding almost causing civil war.

The tribes settling east of Jordan built a large altar. The western tribes assumed idolatry and prepared for war. But the altar was a memorial, not for sacrifice—a witness that they too belonged to Israel.

Communication clarified the misunderstanding. Today we see the danger of assumptions and the value of dialogue.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 saw the altar misunderstanding. Today we hear Joshua''s farewell challenge—"choose for yourselves."

Joshua gathered Israel and reviewed God''s faithfulness. Then the challenge: "If serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."

"But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD" (Joshua 24:15). Today we hear the call to decisive commitment.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 heard Joshua''s challenge. Today we examine themes: faithfulness, obedience, and incomplete conquest.

God was completely faithful—every promise kept. Israel''s obedience brought victory; disobedience brought defeat. But conquest was incomplete—Canaanites remained, setting up future problems.

"Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses" (Joshua 23:6). Today we see the pattern: God''s faithfulness, human response, and consequences.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Joshua: transition, preparation, crossing, Jericho, Ai, campaigns, land division, near-civil-war, and Joshua''s farewell.

"You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled" (Joshua 23:14).

As you complete this study, what has Joshua''s story taught you? About God''s faithfulness? About obedience''s importance? About incomplete obedience''s consequences? God keeps His promises—will you keep your commitment?'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 introduced the cycle and early judges. Today we meet Gideon—unlikely deliverer requiring confirmation.

Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide from Midianites. The angel addressed him: "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior." Gideon''s response: doubt and questions.

God patiently provided signs: the fleece wet then dry. Gideon finally believed. Today we see God patiently working with a doubter.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 introduced Gideon. Today we see his victory—300 men defeating a vast army.

God reduced Gideon''s army from 32,000 to 300, "lest Israel boast against me, saying, ''My own hand has saved me''" (Judges 7:2). With torches, jars, and trumpets, they routed the Midianites.

Victory came through weakness, not strength. Today we see God''s power displayed through human inadequacy.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed Gideon''s victory. Today we see his failure—the ephod that became a snare.

Gideon refused to be king but made a gold ephod from the spoil. "All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family" (Judges 8:27).

Good beginnings don''t guarantee good endings. Gideon the deliverer became Gideon the snare-maker. Today we see how success can lead to failure.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw Gideon''s failure. Today we meet Jephthah—the outcast who became judge.

Jephthah was driven out by his half-brothers as a prostitute''s son. But when Ammon attacked, Israel begged him to lead. He did—and won.

But he made a rash vow, and his daughter paid the price. Today we see the tragedy of foolish words.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Jephthah. Today we begin Samson''s story—miraculous birth, Nazirite calling.

An angel announced Samson''s birth to his barren mother: "He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines" (Judges 13:5). He was to be a Nazirite—set apart.

From before birth, Samson was marked for God''s purposes. Today we see divine calling before human awareness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 introduced Samson. Today we see his strength and his weakness—Spirit-empowered but self-destructive.

The Spirit rushed upon Samson, enabling superhuman feats. He killed a lion, defeated Philistines, broke ropes. But he also pursued Philistine women, broke his Nazirite vows, and followed his desires.

"He did not know that the LORD had left him" (Judges 16:20). Today we see gifts without character.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Samson''s contradictions. Today we witness his downfall—Delilah discovering the secret.

Delilah pestered Samson until "he was sick to death of it" and told her everything. His hair was cut; his strength left; the Philistines captured and blinded him.

"The dead he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life" (Judges 16:30). Even in tragedy, God used him. Today we see the cost of compromise.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 witnessed Samson''s fall. Today we enter the epilogue: "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (Judges 17:6).

The final chapters show religious corruption (Micah''s idolatry), moral collapse (the Levite''s concubine), and tribal warfare (Benjamin nearly destroyed). Complete chaos.

Without leadership, without obedience, society disintegrates. Today we see where everyone doing "what was right in their own eyes" leads.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw societal collapse. Today we reflect on the cycle: sin, suffering, crying out, deliverance, peace—then repeat.

Israel never learned permanently. Each generation repeated the pattern. The judges provided temporary relief, not lasting change.

The book points to the need for a king, but beyond that, the need for a better deliverer than any human judge could be. Today we see the longing for lasting salvation.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Judges: the cycle, Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, and the chaos of the epilogue.

"In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (Judges 21:25). The book ends where it began—in need.

As you complete this study, what has Judges taught you? About human nature? About God''s patience? About the need for real salvation? Judges is a dark book that makes us long for a King who truly saves.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed the temple built. Today we see its dedication—God''s glory filling the house.

Solomon spoke a remarkable prayer acknowledging that heaven cannot contain God, much less a temple. Yet he asked God to hear prayers offered toward this place.

"When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering... The glory of the LORD filled the temple" (2 Chronicles 7:1). Today we witness God accepting the house built for His name.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw the temple dedicated. Today we hear God''s conditional promise—blessing requires faithfulness.

God appeared to Solomon at night with promise and warning: "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray... then I will hear from heaven" (2 Chronicles 7:14).

But also warning: if they abandon God, He will reject the temple and make Israel an object of ridicule. Today we hear both promise and warning.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 heard God''s promise and warning. Today we see Solomon''s wealth and fame—prosperity like no other.

"King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth" (1 Kings 10:23). The Queen of Sheba came and was overwhelmed: "The report I heard... did not tell me half of it."

Everything Solomon touched prospered. But prosperity contains danger. Today we see blessing that would become burden.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed Solomon''s prosperity. Today we examine his proverbs—wisdom for daily living.

Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs and wrote the book of Proverbs. Topics: wisdom vs. folly, diligence vs. laziness, speech, money, relationships, parenting, leadership.

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10). Solomon''s proverbs teach practical godliness. Today we sample wisdom from Israel''s wisest.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Proverbs. Today we examine Ecclesiastes—wisdom''s limits.

"Meaningless! Meaningless!... Everything is meaningless" (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Solomon explored pleasure, achievement, wisdom, wealth—and found them all "chasing after the wind."

Under the sun, nothing satisfies. Only eternity gives meaning to time. Today we wrestle with Ecclesiastes'' difficult wisdom.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Ecclesiastes. Today we examine Song of Songs—celebrating love.

The Song of Songs celebrates romantic love between husband and wife. It''s frank, beautiful, and in the Bible.

"Love is as strong as death... Many waters cannot quench love" (Song of Songs 8:6-7). God gave romantic love; it deserves celebration. Today we see wisdom applied to love.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Song of Songs. Today we see Solomon''s downfall begin—many wives, divided heart.

"King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women... He had seven hundred wives... and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray" (1 Kings 11:1-3). The wisest man made the most foolish choices.

He built high places for his wives'' gods. His heart was not fully devoted like David''s. Today we see the beginning of the end.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 saw compromise begin. Today we see consequences accumulate—enemies raised, kingdom promised to another.

God raised adversaries against Solomon and announced through a prophet: "I will tear the kingdom from your son''s hand" (1 Kings 11:12). The golden age was ending.

Solomon couldn''t undo decades of compromise. Today we see that consequences follow choices—even for the wise.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw consequences. Today we see the kingdom divide—the bitter fruit of Solomon''s later years.

After Solomon''s death, his son Rehoboam rejected wise counsel and oppressed the people further. Ten tribes rebelled. The united kingdom of David and Solomon split permanently.

"The king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD" (1 Kings 12:15). Today we see the tragic aftermath of a compromised reign.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Solomon: divine gift of wisdom, building the temple, unmatched prosperity, wisdom literature, then compromise, consequences, and kingdom division.

"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" (Mark 8:36). Solomon gained everything and lost what mattered.

As you complete this study, what has Solomon''s life taught you? Wisdom without faithfulness isn''t enough. Finishing well matters more than starting well. Guard your heart.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Amos and Obadiah. Today we examine Jonah—the reluctant prophet who learned about God''s compassion.

Jonah ran from God''s call to preach to Nineveh. After the fish, he obeyed—and preached with such power that the entire city repented. Then Jonah sulked because God showed mercy.

"Should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh?" (Jonah 4:11). God''s compassion extends further than His prophets'' comfort. Today we see God''s heart for even enemies.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined Jonah. Today we explore Micah—justice, mercy, and walking humbly.

Micah thundered against injustice in Israel and Judah. Leaders were corrupt; prophets were for hire; the rich oppressed the poor. But Micah also saw hope.

"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). Today we hear the prophetic call to authentic faith.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined Micah. Today we explore Nahum—God''s judgment on Nineveh (again).

A century after Jonah, Nineveh had returned to wickedness. Nahum proclaimed its doom: "The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished" (Nahum 1:3).

Nineveh fell in 612 BC, just as prophesied. Today we see that patience has limits.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined Nahum. Today we explore Habakkuk—the prophet who questioned God.

Habakkuk asked: Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? God answered: I''m raising Babylon to judge Judah. Habakkuk''s second question: Why use someone more wicked to punish the wicked?

God''s answer: the righteous will live by faith; Babylon too will be judged. "Though the fig tree does not bud... yet I will rejoice in the LORD" (Habakkuk 3:17-18). Today we learn faith amid confusion.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Habakkuk. Today we explore Zephaniah—the day of the LORD.

Zephaniah prophesied during Josiah''s reign, warning of coming judgment. "The great day of the LORD is near... That day will be a day of wrath" (Zephaniah 1:14-15). But beyond judgment comes restoration.

"The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you" (3:17). Today we see judgment leading to joy.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 examined Zephaniah. Today we explore Haggai—rebuilding the temple.

The exiles had returned but neglected the temple while building their own homes. Haggai confronted their priorities: "Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?" (Haggai 1:4).

They responded; the temple was completed. Today we examine our priorities.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 examined Haggai. Today we explore Zechariah—visions and the coming King.

Zechariah''s visions encouraged the temple builders with images of future glory. His prophecies point to Christ: the Branch, the Shepherd who would be struck, the King coming on a donkey.

"Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey" (Zechariah 9:9). Today we see messianic hope.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 examined Zechariah. Today we explore Malachi—the last prophetic voice.

Malachi addressed a cynical, weary people. They offered defective sacrifices, divorced their wives, withheld tithes, and questioned whether serving God was worthwhile.

"I the LORD do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed" (Malachi 3:6). After Malachi, 400 years of prophetic silence—until John the Baptist. Today we hear the Old Testament''s last word.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored Malachi. Today we examine themes across the Minor Prophets.

Common themes include: God''s covenant faithfulness, the call to repentance, judgment on sin (Israel''s and nations''), the "day of the LORD," and hope for restoration. Different voices, unified message.

These twelve small books pack enormous theological punch. Today we synthesize their shared message.',
day14_context = 'We''ve surveyed the Minor Prophets: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

Twelve diverse voices spanning centuries, all declaring: God is holy, sin has consequences, repentance is possible, and hope remains.

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored internal righteousness vs. external show. Today we continue examining Jesus'' ethics: anger, lust, and integrity.

"You have heard that it was said... But I tell you" (Matthew 5:21-22). Jesus addresses not just murder but anger, not just adultery but lust, not just oath-breaking but all deception.

Internal reality matters. Heart precedes hand. Today we examine the deeper righteousness Jesus requires.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined heart issues. Today we explore Jesus'' teaching on relationships—reconciliation, enemies, divorce.

"If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you... first go and be reconciled" (Matthew 5:23-24). Right worship requires right relationships.

Love your enemies. Pray for persecutors. Be peacemakers. Today we see relational righteousness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored relationships. Today we examine spiritual practices—giving, praying, fasting (Matthew 6:1-18).

"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them" (Matthew 6:1). The issue isn''t whether to practice but how—for audience of God or audience of people?

Secret giving, private prayer, hidden fasting—these please the Father who sees in secret. Today we examine our motivations.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed spiritual practices. Today we examine the Lord''s Prayer—the model Jesus gave (Matthew 6:9-13).

Our Father—intimate relationship. In heaven—transcendent glory. Hallowed be your name—worship precedes requests. Your kingdom come—His agenda first. Give us daily bread—dependent trust. Forgive as we forgive—interconnected grace. Lead us not into temptation—humble reliance.

Every phrase is loaded. Today we pray the prayer slowly.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored the Lord''s Prayer. Today we examine money and worry (Matthew 6:19-34).

"You cannot serve both God and money" (6:24). Money makes a terrible master. Where treasure is, heart follows.

"Do not worry" appears three times. Look at birds; consider lilies. Your Father knows your needs. "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you" (6:33). Today we address worry with truth.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored money and worry. Today we examine judging and discernment (Matthew 7:1-6).

"Do not judge, or you too will be judged" (7:1). But also: "Do not give dogs what is sacred" (7:6). Which is it? Hypocritical judging is condemned; wise discernment is required.

First remove your plank; then help with specks. Judge yourself first. Today we balance non-judgment with discernment.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed judging. Today we explore asking, seeking, knocking—and the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:7-12).

"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened" (7:7). God is a good Father who gives good gifts.

"In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you" (7:12). The Golden Rule summarizes all ethics. Today we ask boldly and treat others well.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored asking and the Golden Rule. Today we examine two ways—narrow gate, false prophets, tree and fruit (Matthew 7:13-23).

The narrow gate is less traveled but leads to life. Wide gate is popular but leads to destruction.

"By their fruit you will recognize them" (7:20). Claims aren''t enough; even miracles aren''t enough. Jesus will say to some: "I never knew you." Today we examine our fruit.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 examined two ways. Today we conclude with two builders—the parable that ends the sermon (Matthew 7:24-27).

"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock" (7:24). Hearing isn''t enough; practice matters.

Storms come to both houses. Only one stands. Today we commit to building on rock.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through the Sermon on the Mount: Beatitudes, salt and light, surpassing righteousness, heart issues, relationships, practices, prayer, money, worry, judgment, asking, two ways, and two builders.

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored God''s omniscience. Today we examine His omnipotence—all-powerful, nothing impossible.

"Is anything too hard for the LORD?" (Genesis 18:14). God creates from nothing, sustains everything, and will one day renew all things. No force opposes Him successfully.

"Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him" (Psalm 115:3). This isn''t arbitrary power but purposeful sovereignty. Today we trust the One for whom nothing is impossible.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored omnipotence. Today we examine God''s omnipresence—everywhere present.

"Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" (Psalm 139:7). God isn''t located in one place; He fills all creation. You cannot escape Him—or be abandoned by Him.

This is comfort, not threat. Wherever you go, He''s there. Today we practice awareness of His presence.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored omnipresence. Today we examine God''s immutability—He doesn''t change.

"I the LORD do not change" (Malachi 3:6). His character remains constant. His purposes don''t shift. His promises don''t expire.

This provides security in an unstable world. The God of Abraham is your God. Today we anchor in His unchanging nature.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored immutability. Today we examine God''s eternity—beyond time.

"Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole earth, from everlasting to everlasting you are God" (Psalm 90:2). God has no beginning, no end, and isn''t bound by time.

He sees past, present, and future simultaneously. Today we worship the eternal One.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored eternity. Today we examine God''s holiness—set apart, pure, other.

"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty" (Isaiah 6:3). Seraphim cover their faces. Isaiah cries "Woe to me!" Holiness separates God from all creation in moral purity.

"Be holy, because I am holy" (1 Peter 1:16). We''re called to reflect His holiness. Today we approach the Holy One.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored holiness. Today we examine God''s love—not just what He does but who He is.

"God is love" (1 John 4:8). Love isn''t merely an attribute among many; it characterizes His essence. The cross demonstrates love''s depths.

"This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son" (1 John 4:10). Today we rest in divine love.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored love. Today we examine God''s justice—righteous judgment.

"He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just" (Deuteronomy 32:4). God cannot ignore evil. Justice demands response to sin.

But at the cross, justice and mercy meet. Sin is punished; sinners are forgiven. Today we trust the just Judge.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored justice. Today we examine God''s mercy—compassion toward the undeserving.

"The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness" (Exodus 34:6). Mercy triumphs over judgment for those who repent.

We don''t get what we deserve; we get grace instead. Today we receive mercy.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored mercy. Today we examine God''s faithfulness—keeping every promise.

"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations" (Deuteronomy 7:9). What He promises, He performs.

"God is faithful, who has called you" (1 Corinthians 1:9). Bank on His faithfulness. Today we trust the promise-keeper.',

Deuteronomy 28 details covenant blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. The lists are extensive. Blessing: prosperity, health, victory. Curse: disease, defeat, exile.

Israel chose, and history records the consequences. Today we see that covenantal life involves real choices with real outcomes.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored blessings and curses. Today we examine the Davidic covenant—a throne forever.

"Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever" (2 Samuel 7:16). God promised David a dynasty that would never end.

Human Davidic kings failed, but the promise stands—fulfilled ultimately in Christ, David''s greater Son. Today we trace the royal covenant.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined the Davidic covenant. Today we explore its conditionality—individual discipline, unconditional promise.

Individual kings faced discipline for disobedience. Solomon''s kingdom was divided. Others were removed. But the line continued. The promise was unconditional; the individual experience was conditional.

"When he does wrong, I will punish him... But my love will never be taken away" (2 Samuel 7:14-15). Today we see nuanced covenant faithfulness.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Davidic nuances. Today we examine prophetic anticipation of the new covenant.

"The days are coming... when I will make a new covenant... I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts" (Jeremiah 31:31-33). The prophets looked forward to something better.

Internal transformation. Complete forgiveness. Universal knowledge of God. Today we see the old covenant pointing beyond itself.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored prophetic anticipation. Today we examine Jesus inaugurating the new covenant.

"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you" (Luke 22:20). Jesus'' death established what prophets predicted.

The new covenant brings: complete forgiveness (Hebrews 10:17-18), the Spirit''s indwelling (Ezekiel 36:27), and access to God (Hebrews 10:19). Today we receive new covenant blessings.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw new covenant inauguration. Today we explore the relationship between covenants—continuity and discontinuity.

Are old covenants replaced or fulfilled? Both/and. Jesus fulfilled what was promised; He also brought something new. Old covenant types give way to new covenant realities.

"The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Today we trace the covenant story''s progression.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored covenant relationships. Today we examine the sign of the new covenant—not circumcision but baptism and communion.

Baptism initiates into the covenant community. Communion regularly renews covenant remembrance. These signs point to covenant realities: union with Christ, feeding on Christ.

"Is not the cup of thanksgiving... a participation in the blood of Christ?" (1 Corinthians 10:16). Today we practice covenant signs.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored covenant signs. Today we examine covenant community—the church as covenant people.

Israel was a covenant community; the church is the new covenant community. We belong to each other because we belong to Christ.

"You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God''s special possession" (1 Peter 2:9). Today we embrace covenant community identity.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored covenant community. Today we examine covenant consummation—where it''s all heading.

"God''s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them" (Revelation 21:3). The covenant promise of "I will be their God, and they will be my people" finds ultimate fulfillment in the new creation.

All covenants point here. Today we anticipate covenant completion.',
day14_context = 'We''ve traced covenants: creation, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and the new covenant in Christ—their relationships, signs, community, and consummation.

"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matthew 26:28).

As you complete this study, do you understand your covenant relationship with God better? You belong to Him; He belongs to you. Live as covenant people.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored entering the kingdom. Today we examine living in the kingdom—kingdom values and ethics.

The Sermon on the Mount describes kingdom life: blessedness through meekness, mercy, purity. Kingdom citizens are salt and light. They love enemies, don''t retaliate, and trust their Father.

"Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33). Kingdom priority reorders everything else. Today we embrace kingdom values.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored kingdom ethics. Today we examine the kingdom''s growth—parables of expansion.

The kingdom is like a mustard seed: smallest beginning, largest result. Like leaven: permeating everything it touches. Like a treasure or pearl: worth everything to possess.

These parables reveal: the kingdom starts small but grows irresistibly, and it''s worth any sacrifice. Today we see kingdom growth dynamics.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored kingdom parables. Today we examine kingdom community—the church as kingdom expression.

Jesus gave Peter "the keys of the kingdom" (Matthew 16:19). The church isn''t the kingdom but is the primary kingdom community on earth, where King Jesus is acknowledged and obeyed.

Church practices—worship, fellowship, discipline, mission—are kingdom practices. Today we connect church and kingdom.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 connected church and kingdom. Today we examine kingdom power—signs of the King.

Jesus'' miracles weren''t just compassion (though they were) but kingdom signs. When He cast out demons: "If I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matthew 12:28).

Healing, deliverance, provision—all signs that the King has come. Today we see kingdom power breaking through.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored kingdom power. Today we examine kingdom conflict—opposition is expected.

"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence" (Matthew 11:12). The kingdom advances against opposition.

Satan''s kingdom resists. World systems oppose. Our flesh rebels. But the King has already won. Today we expect conflict while trusting victory.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored kingdom conflict. Today we examine already/not yet—the kingdom''s present and future.

The kingdom has come: Jesus reigns now. The kingdom is coming: full manifestation awaits His return. We live in the overlap, experiencing partial fulfillment while awaiting complete fulfillment.

"Your kingdom come" is present reality and future hope. Today we live in the tension.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored already/not yet. Today we examine the kingdom''s consummation—when Christ returns.

"Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power" (1 Corinthians 15:24). Christ''s return brings kingdom completion.

Every knee will bow. Every enemy will be defeated. God will be all in all. Today we anticipate the kingdom''s fullness.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored consummation. Today we examine kingdom mission—we''re sent to proclaim.

"This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come" (Matthew 24:14). Kingdom proclamation is our mission.

We announce that a King has come, a kingdom exists, and citizenship is available through repentance and faith. Today we embrace kingdom mission.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored mission. Today we examine kingdom identity—citizens with responsibilities.

"Our citizenship is in heaven" (Philippians 3:20). Kingdom citizens live under kingdom authority wherever they are. We represent the King.

This means living by kingdom values in a world with different values, extending kingdom grace, and advancing kingdom purposes. Today we live as kingdom citizens.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored God''s kingdom: its nature, Jesus'' proclamation, entering, living, growing, community, power, conflict, timing, consummation, mission, and citizenship.

"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10).

As you complete this study, how will kingdom reality shape your living? The King reigns. Live under His rule.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored our positional holiness in Christ. Today we examine progressive holiness—growing in Christlikeness.

Positional holiness is instant at conversion; progressive holiness takes a lifetime. "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2). Transformation is process.

This involves Spirit''s power, Scripture''s truth, community''s support, and our cooperation. Today we commit to the growth process.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored progressive holiness. Today we examine holiness in thought life—where battles are won or lost.

"Take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5). Thoughts precede actions. Mental purity produces behavioral purity.

What do you dwell on? What enters your mind through media, conversation, imagination? Today we address thought-life holiness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed thoughts. Today we examine holiness in speech—words matter.

"The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body" (James 3:6). Words bless or curse, build or destroy, heal or wound.

"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths" (Ephesians 4:29). Holy people speak holy words. Today we pursue holiness in speech.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed speech. Today we examine holiness in relationships—with family, friends, and enemies.

"Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy" (Hebrews 12:14). Holiness isn''t monastic isolation but transformed relating.

Holiness in relationships means: truthfulness, forgiveness, patience, serving, and loving even difficult people. Today we pursue relational holiness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed relationships. Today we examine holiness in work—Monday through Friday matters.

"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord" (Colossians 3:23). Holy work means: excellence, integrity, servant-heartedness, and witness.

Your workplace is your primary mission field. Holiness there displays kingdom reality. Today we pursue vocational holiness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 addressed work. Today we examine holiness in sexuality—counter-cultural purity.

"It is God''s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality" (1 Thessalonians 4:3). Sexual holiness is explicitly mentioned because it''s explicitly challenged.

In a sexually saturated culture, purity requires intentionality. Boundaries matter. Accountability helps. Today we pursue sexual holiness.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed sexuality. Today we examine holiness in money—stewardship over accumulation.

"No one can serve two masters... You cannot serve both God and money" (Matthew 6:24). Money easily becomes idol. Holy money management treats it as tool, not goal.

Contentment, generosity, and trust characterize financial holiness. Today we pursue holiness with money.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed money. Today we examine hindrances to holiness—what blocks our growth.

Hindrances include: unconfessed sin, unforgiveness, worldly input, bad company, spiritual neglect, and unbelief that change is possible.

"Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles" (Hebrews 12:1). Today we identify and address hindrances.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 identified hindrances. Today we examine helps to holiness—practices that promote growth.

Helps include: Scripture saturation, consistent prayer, Spirit-reliance, accountability, worship, fasting, service, and suffering rightly received.

"Train yourself to be godly" (1 Timothy 4:7). Training requires discipline. Today we employ means of grace.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored holiness: God''s holiness, our calling, positional and progressive holiness, thought life, speech, relationships, work, sexuality, money, hindrances, and helps.

"Just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do" (1 Peter 1:15).

As you complete this study, where do you most need to grow? Holiness is both gift and pursuit. Press on.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Jesus praying in crisis. Today we examine His prayer rhythm—regular withdrawal for prayer.

"Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed" (Mark 1:35). This wasn''t exception but pattern.

Jesus was busy, in demand, effective—yet He prioritized prayer. If He needed it, how much more do we? Today we establish prayer rhythm.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored Jesus'' prayer rhythm. Today we examine His prayer locations—mountain, garden, wilderness.

Jesus prayed on mountains (Luke 6:12), in the wilderness (Luke 5:16), in gardens (Luke 22:41), in crowds (Matthew 14:23). Location varied; prayer happened.

The point isn''t specific place but intentional seeking. Today we find our places to pray.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored prayer locations. Today we examine Jesus'' prayer posture—He modeled various postures.

Jesus looked up to heaven (John 17:1), fell on His face (Matthew 26:39), knelt (Luke 22:41). He prayed standing in public, prostrate in anguish.

Posture isn''t magic but can express heart. Today we consider how physical posture serves prayer.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed prayer posture. Today we explore Jesus teaching on persistence—keep asking.

"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened" (Matthew 7:7). All three verbs suggest continuous action: keep asking, keep seeking, keep knocking.

The parable of the persistent widow reinforces: "always pray and not give up" (Luke 18:1). Today we persist in prayer.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored persistence. Today we examine Jesus teaching on faith—believing prayer.

"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ''Go, throw yourself into the sea,'' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them" (Mark 11:23).

Faith isn''t magic formula but trust in a good Father. Today we pray with faith.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored faith. Today we examine Jesus teaching on forgiveness in prayer—unforgiveness blocks.

"When you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins" (Mark 11:25).

Unforgiveness toward others hinders prayer. Forgiveness releases us to receive. Today we forgive so we can pray freely.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed forgiveness. Today we examine Jesus'' high priestly prayer—John 17.

Jesus prayed for Himself (glorification), for His disciples (protection, sanctification), and for all believers (unity, witness). The entire chapter is prayer.

This is the longest recorded prayer of Jesus—a window into His heart. Today we meditate on John 17.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored John 17. Today we examine Jesus praying for others—intercession.

Jesus prayed for Peter specifically: "Simon, I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail" (Luke 22:32). He intercedes for us still (Hebrews 7:25).

Praying for others is Christ-like prayer. Today we follow Jesus'' intercessory example.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored intercession. Today we examine Jesus praying for enemies—radical prayer.

"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). Even while being crucified, Jesus prayed for His crucifiers.

"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44). Today we pray for enemies.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored Jesus'' prayer life: His model prayer, solitary prayer, crisis prayer, rhythm, locations, posture, persistence, faith, forgiveness, high priestly prayer, intercession, and praying for enemies.

"One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, ''Lord, teach us to pray''" (Luke 11:1).

As you complete this study, how will you pray differently? Jesus modeled prayer. Follow Him.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored putting off old patterns. Today we examine putting on new patterns—replacement is key.

You can''t just stop thinking wrongly; you must start thinking rightly. "Put off your old self... and... put on the new self" (Ephesians 4:22-24). The metaphor is clothing: take off, put on.

What will replace the lies you''ve believed? Today we identify replacement truths.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored replacement. Today we examine the role of Scripture—renewing happens through truth.

"Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth" (John 17:17). Scripture is primary truth source. Mind renewal happens through Scripture saturation.

Reading, meditating, memorizing, studying—all bring Scripture into the mind''s renewal process. Today we commit to Scripture saturation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored Scripture''s role. Today we examine meditation—not just reading but dwelling.

"Blessed is the one... whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night" (Psalm 1:1-2). Meditation is slow, repeated, thoughtful engagement with truth.

Joshua was told to meditate day and night for success (Joshua 1:8). Today we practice biblical meditation.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored meditation. Today we examine memorization—truth available anytime.

"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11). Memorized Scripture is available when books aren''t—in temptation, crisis, opportunity.

Memorization takes effort but pays dividends. Today we begin or continue memorizing.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored memorization. Today we address lies we believe—identifying false thinking.

Common lies: "I''m worthless." "God is disappointed in me." "I can never change." "I need others'' approval." "My past defines me."

Identify lies by examining recurring struggles, emotional reactions, and internal self-talk. Today we identify our specific lies.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 identified lies. Today we replace lies with truth—specific counters.

For "I''m worthless": "I am God''s workmanship" (Ephesians 2:10). For "God is disappointed": "There is no condemnation" (Romans 8:1). For "I can never change": "I am a new creation" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

Specific lies need specific truth. Today we pair lies with countering Scripture.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 paired lies with truth. Today we examine thoughts and emotions—they''re connected.

Wrong thinking produces wrong feeling. Depressed thoughts produce depressed moods. Anxious thoughts produce anxious feelings.

Changing thoughts changes emotions—not instantly, but really. "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2). Today we see the thought-emotion connection.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 connected thoughts and emotions. Today we explore the Spirit''s role—renewal isn''t self-help.

"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind" (Ephesians 4:23). The Holy Spirit renews. We cooperate, but He transforms.

Rely on the Spirit, not willpower alone. Today we invite Spirit-empowered renewal.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored the Spirit''s role. Today we address setbacks—old patterns return.

Renewal isn''t instant or linear. Old thoughts resurface. Patterns reassert themselves. What then?

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us" (1 John 1:9). Setbacks are not disqualification. Get back up. Today we handle setbacks with grace.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored mind renewal: the command, how minds work, putting off and on, Scripture''s role, meditation, memorization, lies, truth, emotions, the Spirit, and setbacks.

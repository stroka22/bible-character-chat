-- LIFE OF ABRAHAM 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Abraham''s generous handling of conflict with Lot. Today we see God reaffirm His promise after Lot''s departure.

"Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west. All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever" (Genesis 13:14-15). After Abraham gave Lot first choice, God gave Abraham everything.

Generosity born of trust loses nothing and gains everything. Abraham trusted God with the outcome; God rewarded that trust abundantly. Today we see that letting go often leads to receiving more.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw God''s reaffirmation. Today Abraham rescues Lot and encounters the mysterious Melchizedek.

Lot was captured by invading kings. Abraham assembled 318 trained servants, pursued, defeated the kings, and rescued Lot. Then Melchizedek—king of Salem, priest of God Most High—appeared and blessed Abraham, who gave him a tenth of everything (Genesis 14).

Hebrews explores Melchizedek as a type of Christ. This mysterious figure reminds us that God had faithful worshippers even outside Abraham''s line. Today we see Abraham the warrior and worshipper.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 introduced Melchizedek. Today we witness the covenant ceremony of Genesis 15—God''s unconditional promise.

Abraham asked how he could know God''s promises were certain. God instructed him to arrange a covenant ceremony. Then, in deep darkness, God alone (as smoking fire pot and blazing torch) passed between the pieces.

Normally both parties would pass through, taking the curse on themselves if they broke covenant. But only God passed—He took all the obligation upon Himself. Today we see unconditional promise backed by God''s own oath.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed the covenant ceremony. Today we see Abraham and Sarah''s attempt to help God through Hagar.

Sarah was barren. She suggested Abraham have a child through her servant Hagar—culturally acceptable but outside God''s plan. Ishmael was born, and conflict immediately arose between Sarah and Hagar.

Running ahead of God''s timing produces complications. The Ishmael-Isaac conflict echoes through history. Today we see the consequences of impatience and the importance of waiting for God''s way, not just God''s goal.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Hagar and Ishmael. Today God reaffirms His covenant and institutes circumcision (Genesis 17).

God changed Abram''s name to Abraham ("father of many") and Sarai''s to Sarah. He promised a son through Sarah within a year. Abraham laughed—not in mockery but in astonishment. "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old?" (Genesis 17:17).

Circumcision became the covenant sign—a permanent, physical mark of belonging to God''s people. Today we see God patiently reaffirming His promise to a still-waiting Abraham.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw covenant reaffirmation. Today Abraham intercedes for Sodom—bold negotiation with God.

God revealed His intention to investigate Sodom''s wickedness. Abraham, concerned for Lot, negotiated: "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty... forty-five... forty... thirty... twenty... ten?" (Genesis 18:23-32).

God agreed to spare the city for ten righteous. There weren''t even ten. But Abraham''s intercession reveals a heart for others and confidence to approach God boldly. Today we learn to intercede from Abraham''s example.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 witnessed intercession for Sodom. Today we see Sodom''s destruction and Lot''s rescue—the answer to Abraham''s prayer.

Angels arrived in Sodom. The city''s wickedness was confirmed. Lot and his family were urged to flee. "Lot''s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt" (Genesis 19:26). Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.

Lot was saved "as one escaping through flames" (1 Corinthians 3:15). His life was spared, but everything he''d built in Sodom was lost. Today we see the cost of worldly compromise and the limits of being rescued.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 witnessed Sodom''s destruction. Today we finally see the promise fulfilled: Isaac is born.

"Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him" (Genesis 21:2). Twenty-five years after the initial promise, the child of promise arrived.

Sarah laughed—this time with joy. "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me" (21:6). The impossible became reality. Today we celebrate promise fulfilled after long waiting.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 celebrated Isaac''s birth. Today we reach the summit: Abraham''s test on Mount Moriah.

"Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and... sacrifice him there as a burnt offering" (Genesis 22:2). This command seems to contradict everything God had promised. Yet Abraham obeyed.

Abraham "reasoned that God could even raise the dead" (Hebrews 11:19). His faith had grown so strong that even this incomprehensible command couldn''t shake his trust. God provided a ram; Isaac was spared. Today we witness faith''s ultimate test.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Abraham: his call, his failures, his growth, the covenant, waiting, intercession, Isaac''s birth, and the supreme test on Moriah.

"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness" (Romans 4:3). His faith, not his perfection, defined him.

As you complete this study, what has Abraham''s journey taught you about faith? About waiting? About trust? The father of faith was a flawed man who learned to believe God. So can you.'

-- LIFE OF JOSEPH 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Joseph''s rise and fall in Egypt—from Potiphar''s house to prison. Today we see him in prison, still faithful.

Joseph didn''t know how long he''d be imprisoned or if he''d ever get out. Yet he served so faithfully that "the warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph''s care" (Genesis 39:23). He flourished even in prison.

Joseph interpreted dreams for Pharaoh''s cupbearer and baker. The cupbearer was restored but "did not remember Joseph; he forgot him" (40:23). Two more years passed. Today we see faithful perseverance when hope seems lost.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw Joseph waiting in prison. Today we witness his dramatic elevation—from prisoner to prime minister in a single day.

Pharaoh dreamed; no one could interpret. Finally, the cupbearer remembered Joseph. Brought before Pharaoh, Joseph interpreted the dreams: seven years of plenty, seven of famine. He proposed a solution, and Pharaoh put him in charge of everything.

"Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?" (Genesis 41:38). At age thirty, thirteen years after his brothers sold him, Joseph rose to power. Today we see God''s timing: sudden elevation after long preparation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed Joseph''s elevation. Today we see the brothers come to Egypt—the beginning of reconciliation.

Famine struck; Jacob sent his sons to Egypt for grain. They bowed before Joseph—unknowingly fulfilling his childhood dreams. Joseph recognized them; they didn''t recognize him.

Joseph tested them, speaking harshly, accusing them of spying, demanding they bring Benjamin. "They said to one another, ''Surely we are being punished because of our brother''" (Genesis 42:21). Guilt surfaced after twenty years. Today we see reconciliation''s careful beginning.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw the brothers'' first visit. Today they return with Benjamin, and Joseph tests them further.

Joseph hosted a feast but still concealed his identity. He seated them in birth order (astonishing them) and gave Benjamin five times as much food. Then he planted his silver cup in Benjamin''s sack.

When the cup was found, Judah—who had suggested selling Joseph—offered himself as substitute for Benjamin. He couldn''t bear his father''s grief again. Today we see transformation: the man who abandoned one brother now sacrifices for another.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 witnessed Judah''s transformation. Today Joseph reveals himself—one of Scripture''s most emotional scenes.

Joseph couldn''t contain himself. He sent everyone out and wept so loudly that Egyptians heard. "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" (Genesis 45:3). The brothers were terrified.

Joseph immediately reframed everything: "Do not be distressed... God sent me ahead of you to preserve life" (45:5). Not minimizing their sin but seeing God''s providence through it. Today we witness reconciliation''s climax.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw Joseph revealed. Today Jacob comes to Egypt—the family reunited at last.

Jacob, initially disbelieving, was persuaded that Joseph lived. God confirmed the move: "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there" (Genesis 46:3). Jacob saw Joseph again after twenty-two years.

Seventy people entered Egypt—the beginning of the nation that would later exodus with millions. Today we see family restoration and God''s long-term plan advancing.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 witnessed the family''s move to Egypt. Today we see Jacob blessing his sons—prophetic words for each tribe.

Before dying, Jacob blessed each son, predicting their tribes'' futures. Judah received the royal promise: "The scepter will not depart from Judah... until he to whom it belongs shall come" (Genesis 49:10). Jesus descended from Judah.

Jacob also adopted Joseph''s sons Ephraim and Manasseh, crossing his hands to bless the younger over the elder—another reversal of birth order. Today we hear prophetic blessings.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 heard Jacob''s blessings. Today we witness Jacob''s death and burial—honoring the promise.

Jacob died and was embalmed Egyptian style. Joseph obtained permission to bury him in Canaan, in the cave Abraham had purchased. "A very large company" accompanied the body.

Jacob insisted on Canaan burial because the promise was for that land, not Egypt. His burial there was an act of faith in promises not yet fulfilled. Today we see hope expressed in burial location.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw Jacob''s burial. Today we see the brothers'' lingering fear—and Joseph''s gracious response.

With Jacob dead, the brothers feared revenge. They sent word claiming Jacob wanted Joseph to forgive them. Joseph wept—hurt that they still didn''t trust his forgiveness.

"Don''t be afraid... You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (Genesis 50:19-20). The key verse of Joseph''s story. Today we see sovereign providence and complete forgiveness.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Joseph: from favored son to slave to prisoner to ruler, from betrayal to reconciliation to preservation of many lives.

"God intended it for good." Joseph''s story shows God''s sovereignty weaving even evil into redemptive purpose. It foreshadows Christ: betrayed by His own, sold for silver, falsely accused, exalted to save.

As you complete this study, what has Joseph''s story taught you about waiting, about forgiveness, about God''s providence? What "pit" might God be using for purposes you can''t yet see?'

-- LIFE OF DAVID 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 followed David through his years as a fugitive. Today we witness his friendship with Jonathan—a covenant of loyalty.

Jonathan, Saul''s son and heir, loved David and made a covenant with him. He gave David his robe, armor, and weapons—symbolically transferring his royal future. Their friendship was "wonderful, more wonderful than that of women" (2 Samuel 1:26).

Jonathan chose friendship with David over his own interests. He protected David from Saul despite the cost. Today we see friendship that sacrifices personal advantage for another''s good.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored David and Jonathan''s friendship. Today we see David''s mercy toward Saul—twice sparing his enemy''s life.

In a cave at En Gedi, David cut off a corner of Saul''s robe but refused to kill him: "The LORD forbid that I should... lay my hand on him; for he is the LORD''s anointed" (1 Samuel 24:6). Later, he crept into Saul''s camp and took his spear but again refused to strike.

David left vengeance to God rather than seizing opportunity. His restraint shows remarkable faith and patience. Today we learn to trust God''s timing rather than forcing outcomes.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw David sparing Saul. Today we witness his lowest point: living among the Philistines, pretending madness, nearly fighting against Israel.

Desperate, David fled to Gath—Goliath''s hometown. He was given a city and pretended to raid Judah while actually attacking Israel''s other enemies. When the Philistines gathered to fight Israel, David almost went with them.

Only divine intervention through suspicious Philistine commanders prevented David from fighting his own people. Even the man after God''s heart had low points. Today we see that faith doesn''t prevent failures, but God protects through them.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored David''s lowest point. Today we see Saul''s death and David''s response—finally becoming king.

Saul and Jonathan died fighting the Philistines on Mount Gilboa. When the news reached David, he composed a lament: "How the mighty have fallen!" (2 Samuel 1:19). No celebration—only grief for Israel''s loss.

David was first anointed king over Judah, then, after seven years, over all Israel. He conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. The long wait was over. Today we see kingship finally realized.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 saw David become king. Today we witness his desire to build God a temple—and God''s surprising response.

David wanted to build a house for God. But God reversed it: "The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you" (2 Samuel 7:11). Not a building but a dynasty.

God promised David an eternal throne. This Davidic covenant points to Christ, David''s descendant who reigns forever. David wanted to give God something; God gave David everything. Today we see grace that out-gives us.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored the Davidic covenant. Today we confront David''s greatest failure: Bathsheba and Uriah.

David saw Bathsheba bathing, desired her, took her, and she became pregnant. To cover his sin, he had her husband Uriah killed in battle. "The thing David had done displeased the LORD" (2 Samuel 11:27).

The man after God''s heart committed adultery and murder. Today we confront the sobering reality that no one is immune to devastating sin.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 confronted David''s sin. Today we see Nathan''s confrontation and David''s repentance.

Nathan told a story about a rich man taking a poor man''s only lamb. David''s anger flared. Nathan declared: "You are the man!" David responded immediately: "I have sinned against the LORD" (2 Samuel 12:13).

David''s repentance was genuine—Psalm 51 records his broken-hearted prayer. "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise" (Psalm 51:17). Today we see that while sin has consequences, genuine repentance receives forgiveness.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 witnessed David''s repentance. Today we see the consequences unfold—sword in David''s house.

Nathan prophesied that "the sword will never depart from your house" (2 Samuel 12:10). The child of adultery died. Amnon raped Tamar. Absalom killed Amnon. Then Absalom rebelled against David himself.

Forgiveness doesn''t eliminate consequences. David spent his later years dealing with fallout from his sin. Today we see the bitter fruit of sin even in forgiven lives.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored consequences. Today we witness Absalom''s rebellion and death—David''s deepest grief.

Absalom stole the hearts of Israel and forced David to flee Jerusalem. Battle ensued. David''s orders were clear: "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake" (2 Samuel 18:5). But Absalom was killed.

David''s grief was unrestrained: "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you" (2 Samuel 18:33). Father-love overwhelmed king-duty. Today we see David''s broken heart.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with David: from shepherd to king, through friendship and fugitive years, through triumph and tragedy, sin and repentance, rebellion and restoration.

"I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart" (Acts 13:22). Despite failures, this was God''s assessment.

As you complete this study, what has David''s life taught you? About hearts after God? About sin''s consequences and repentance''s reality? David''s life was complicated—like ours. God''s grace was sufficient—as it is for us.'

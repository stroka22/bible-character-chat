UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Peter''s restoration by Jesus. Today we see him at Pentecost—transformed from denier to bold proclaimer.

The same Peter who cowered before a servant girl now stood before thousands: "Let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah" (Acts 2:36). Three thousand believed.

What changed? The Holy Spirit. Peter''s courage wasn''t self-generated but Spirit-empowered. Today we see the transformation the Spirit produces in surrendered lives.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 witnessed Pentecost boldness. Today we see Peter healing and preaching at the temple—and facing the Sanhedrin.

Peter healed a lame man at the Beautiful Gate, then preached Christ to the gathered crowd. The authorities arrested him. Before the same council that condemned Jesus, Peter declared: "Salvation is found in no one else" (Acts 4:12).

They noted that Peter and John "had been with Jesus" (4:13). Time with Jesus produces boldness. Today we see courage that comes from communion with Christ.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw Peter before the Sanhedrin. Today we witness a pivotal moment: Peter''s vision at Joppa and the conversion of Cornelius.

Peter saw a sheet descending with unclean animals: "Kill and eat." Peter refused—he''d never eaten anything unclean. God replied: "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean" (Acts 10:15). Then messengers arrived from Cornelius, a Gentile.

Peter went, preached, and the Spirit fell on Gentiles. "Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water?" (10:47). The gospel broke ethnic barriers. Today we see Peter''s expanding understanding of God''s plan.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed Cornelius''s conversion. Today we see Peter imprisoned and miraculously delivered.

Herod arrested Peter, intending execution after Passover. The church prayed earnestly. An angel appeared, chains fell off, doors opened, and Peter walked free. He went to where believers were praying—and they didn''t believe their prayers were answered!

"Peter kept on knocking" (Acts 12:16). The answer stood at the door while they argued about whether it was really him. Today we see prayer answered beyond expectation.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 witnessed Peter''s deliverance. Today we see him at the Jerusalem Council—defending Gentile inclusion.

The question: Must Gentile converts be circumcised? Some said yes. Peter stood and recounted Cornelius''s conversion: "God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us" (Acts 15:8).

Peter''s testimony was crucial. The council decided Gentiles need not become Jews to become Christians. Today we see Peter using his experience to shape church doctrine.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw the Jerusalem Council. Today we confront a difficult moment: Peter''s hypocrisy at Antioch.

Peter ate with Gentiles until certain men came from James. Then he withdrew, fearing criticism. Paul opposed him publicly: "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile... How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?" (Galatians 2:14).

Even after Cornelius, Peter could still slip into old patterns. Spiritual growth isn''t linear. Today we see that even apostles needed correction—and could receive it.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 confronted Peter''s hypocrisy. Today we turn to his letters—Peter the pastor writing to suffering believers.

1 Peter addresses Christians facing persecution. Peter''s theme: suffering with hope. "In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials" (1 Peter 1:6).

Peter knew suffering—he''d face martyrdom. His letters aren''t theory but testimony. Today we hear the pastor who suffered teaching others how to suffer with hope.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 introduced Peter''s letters. Today we explore his teaching on submission—a counter-cultural call.

Peter instructed slaves to submit to masters, wives to husbands, and all to governing authorities. His rationale: Christ submitted to unjust suffering for our sake. "To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example" (1 Peter 2:21).

This isn''t endorsing injustice but teaching how to witness through endurance. Today we grapple with Peter''s challenging teaching on submission.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 examined submission. Today we explore 2 Peter''s warnings—false teachers and the coming judgment.

Peter''s second letter warns against false teachers who "will secretly introduce destructive heresies" (2 Peter 2:1). He describes their characteristics: greed, arrogance, and immorality.

He also addresses scoffers who mock Christ''s return: "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise... Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish" (3:9). Today we heed Peter''s warnings about deception and delay.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Peter: from fisherman to apostle, through failure and restoration, through boldness and hypocrisy, through pastoral care and prophetic warning.

Tradition says Peter was crucified upside down, feeling unworthy to die as Jesus did. The man who denied Christ three times died proclaiming Him.

As you complete this study, what has Peter''s life taught you? About failure and restoration? About growth that isn''t linear? About boldness from the Spirit? Peter''s journey encourages every stumbling disciple.'

-- ELIJAH & ELISHA 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Elijah''s restoration after despair. Today we see him confront Ahab again—over Naboth''s vineyard.

Naboth refused to sell his ancestral inheritance to King Ahab. Jezebel arranged false charges and had Naboth executed. Ahab went to claim the vineyard—and Elijah met him: "Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?... Dogs will lick your blood" (1 Kings 21:19).

Elijah''s courage returned. He confronted royal murder and theft without flinching. Today we see that God restores His servants for continued ministry.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw Naboth''s vineyard. Today we witness Elijah''s departure—taken to heaven in a whirlwind.

Elijah knew his time was near. Elisha refused to leave his side. They crossed the Jordan on dry ground. "A chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind" (2 Kings 2:11).

Elisha cried out, picked up Elijah''s cloak, and struck the Jordan—it parted. The prophetic mantle had transferred. Today we witness the dramatic end of one ministry and beginning of another.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw Elijah''s departure. Today we meet Elisha in ministry—performing his first miracles.

Elisha purified bad water at Jericho with salt. He pronounced judgment on mocking youths (a troubling passage, likely involving young men threatening a prophet). He provided water for armies in the wilderness.

The prophets recognized: "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha" (2 Kings 2:15). Elisha would perform twice as many miracles as Elijah. Today we see Elisha establishing his prophetic authority.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 introduced Elisha''s miracles. Today we witness one of his most personal: the Shunammite woman''s son.

A wealthy woman in Shunem provided hospitality for Elisha. He promised her a son. The child was born but later died. She rushed to Elisha. He came, prayed, and raised the boy from death.

This miracle of resurrection foreshadows Christ''s power over death. Today we see Elisha''s compassion and God''s power over the ultimate enemy.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 saw the Shunammite''s son raised. Today we witness Naaman''s healing—a proud general humbled.

Naaman, commander of Aram''s army, had leprosy. A captured Israelite servant girl suggested he visit Israel''s prophet. Elisha didn''t even meet him—just sent word: "Wash yourself seven times in the Jordan" (2 Kings 5:10).

Naaman was furious at the ordinary instruction. His servants reasoned with him; he obeyed; he was healed. "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel" (5:15). Today we see that God''s way often offends our pride.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw Naaman''s healing. Today we witness Elisha''s servant Gehazi''s failure—greed that brought leprosy.

After Naaman was healed, Elisha refused payment. But Gehazi chased Naaman and lied to obtain money and clothing. Elisha knew: "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot?" Naaman''s leprosy would cling to Gehazi (2 Kings 5:26-27).

Contrast: Naaman humbled and healed; Gehazi proud and leprous. Today we see the danger of using spiritual ministry for personal gain.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 saw Gehazi''s failure. Today we witness Elisha in military conflict—surrounded yet secure.

The king of Aram was frustrated: his battle plans kept being thwarted. He learned Elisha was revealing them to Israel. He sent an army to capture Elisha. Elisha''s servant panicked.

"Don''t be afraid... Those who are with us are more than those who are with them." Then Elisha prayed, and the servant saw: "the hills full of horses and chariots of fire" (2 Kings 6:16-17). Today we see unseen realities that change visible circumstances.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 revealed heavenly armies. Today we see Elisha during Samaria''s siege—prophesying abundance amid famine.

Samaria was besieged; people were starving, even eating children. Elisha prophesied: "About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel" (2 Kings 7:1). An officer scoffed.

God caused the Aramean army to hear sounds of a massive army and flee, abandoning supplies. The prophecy was fulfilled. The scoffing officer was trampled in the rush and didn''t eat the food he''d doubted would come. Today we see God''s abundance after desperate scarcity.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw siege relief. Today we witness Elisha''s final acts—prophetic power even in death.

Elisha fell ill. King Joash wept over him. Elisha instructed him to shoot an arrow (symbolizing victory over Aram), then strike the ground. Joash struck three times and stopped. Elisha was angry: "You should have struck the ground five or six times" (2 Kings 13:19). Limited obedience brought limited victory.

Even after death, when a body touched Elisha''s bones, the man revived. Today we see prophetic power that outlasted the prophet''s life.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Elijah and Elisha: confrontation and miracles, despair and restoration, departure and succession, compassion and judgment, war and peace.

"The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." The prophetic ministry continued through transition. God''s work is bigger than any one servant.

As you complete this study, what have these prophets taught you? About courage under pressure? About God''s provision and power? About succession and legacy? The same God who worked through them works through His servants today.'

-- MARRIAGE 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 addressed conflict in marriage. Today we explore intimacy—physical, emotional, and spiritual connection.

"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband" (1 Corinthians 7:3). Sexual intimacy in marriage is good, expected, and mutual. Neither spouse should deprive the other except by mutual consent for prayer.

But intimacy is more than physical. Emotional intimacy means knowing and being known. Spiritual intimacy means praying together, growing together, serving together. Today we explore the full dimensions of marital intimacy.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined intimacy. Today we address forgiveness in marriage—essential for long-term health.

Every marriage accumulates hurts. Without forgiveness, resentment builds walls. With forgiveness, offenses become opportunities for grace.

"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you" (Colossians 3:13). The standard: as Christ forgave us—completely. Today we explore making forgiveness a marriage habit.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored forgiveness. Today we examine seasons of marriage—it changes over time.

Newlywed passion differs from parenting exhaustion differs from empty-nest rediscovery differs from aging together. Each season has challenges and gifts.

Ecclesiastes says there''s "a time for everything" (3:1). Seasons change; commitment remains. The couple that navigates seasons together grows deeper than those who only enjoyed the easy times. Today we normalize marriage seasons and prepare for transitions.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed seasons. Today we explore serving each other—marriage as mutual ministry.

"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Ephesians 5:21). Before specific instructions to wives and husbands, Paul calls for mutual submission. Marriage is mutual service.

Jesus washed feet; we serve spouses. What does your spouse need? How can you serve today? Marriage thrives when both partners ask "How can I serve?" rather than "What do I get?" Today we cultivate servant hearts.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined serving. Today we address protecting marriage—it faces real threats.

Threats include: neglect (taking each other for granted), outside attractions (emotional or physical), busyness (no time for each other), conflict avoidance (issues fester), and in-law interference.

"Above all else, guard your heart" (Proverbs 4:23). Guarding marriage means: maintaining boundaries, prioritizing time together, addressing issues early, and keeping the marriage bed honored. Today we identify and address threats.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 examined protecting marriage. Today we explore praying together—spiritual partnership.

Couples who pray together report stronger marriages. Yet many Christian couples rarely pray together. Why? It''s vulnerable. It requires time. It feels awkward.

Peter warned husbands to treat wives well "so that nothing will hinder your prayers" (1 Peter 3:7). Marriage and prayer are connected. Today we commit to praying with and for our spouses.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored praying together. Today we address difficult seasons—when marriage is hard.

Every marriage has hard seasons: financial stress, health crises, parenting struggles, job loss, grief, or simply growing apart. What then?

"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" (1 Corinthians 13:7). Love endures difficulty. It doesn''t quit when quitting seems easier. Today we prepare for (or navigate) marriage''s hard seasons.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed hard seasons. Today we explore growing together—becoming better together than apart.

Healthy marriages make both partners better. "Two are better than one" (Ecclesiastes 4:9). You sharpen each other, encourage each other, complement each other''s weaknesses.

Growing together requires: shared goals, mutual encouragement, honest feedback, and celebrating each other''s growth. Today we ask: Are we growing together or growing apart?',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored growing together. Today we examine leaving a legacy—what your marriage passes on.

Your marriage teaches children (if you have them) what marriage looks like. It witnesses to a watching world. It either commends or undermines the gospel picture marriage represents.

"Grandchildren are the crown of the aged" (Proverbs 17:6). Legacy extends beyond your lifetime. What legacy is your marriage building? Today we consider multi-generational impact.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored marriage: God''s design, roles, communication, conflict, intimacy, forgiveness, seasons, service, protection, prayer, hard times, growth, and legacy.

"This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32). Marriage points to greater reality.

As you complete this study, what will you do differently? What conversations need to happen? What habits need changing? Invest in your marriage—it''s worth the effort and it pictures the gospel.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored discipline. Today we examine instruction—teaching children God''s Word and ways.

"These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road" (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). Teaching is woven through daily life.

This requires: knowing truth ourselves (it must be on our hearts first), intentional teaching moments, and natural conversation about faith. Today we develop strategies for faith instruction.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined instruction. Today we address modeling—children learn more from watching than hearing.

"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" (1 Corinthians 11:1). Paul could say this; can we? Children absorb what they see.

If we want praying children, they must see us pray. If we want generous children, they must see us give. If we want honest children, they must hear us tell truth. Today we examine what our lives are teaching our children.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored modeling. Today we examine different ages—parenting changes as children grow.

Toddlers need different parenting than teenagers. Young children need more control; older children need more coaching; young adults need friendship.

"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child" (1 Corinthians 13:11). Children aren''t mini-adults. Age-appropriate expectations and approaches matter. Today we adapt parenting to developmental stages.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed developmental stages. Today we examine protecting children—spiritual, emotional, and physical safety.

"If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned" (Matthew 18:6). Jesus takes child protection seriously.

Protection includes: guarding what enters their minds (media, relationships), creating safe home environments, teaching them to recognize danger, and being available when they need help. Today we assess our protective practices.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored protection. Today we address releasing children—the goal is launch, not permanent dependence.

"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife" (Genesis 2:24). Leaving is the goal. We raise children to leave well.

This requires progressively releasing control, allowing age-appropriate decisions and consequences, and preparing them for independence. Holding on too tightly prevents healthy development. Today we examine whether we''re preparing children for launch.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 addressed releasing. Today we explore praying for children—our most important parenting practice.

Job "would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, ''Perhaps my children have sinned''... This was Job''s regular custom" (Job 1:5). Job covered his children in prayer regularly.

We can''t control our children''s choices, but we can pray for them. Prayer invites God''s work in their lives. Today we develop consistent prayer practices for our children.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 examined praying for children. Today we address prodigals—when children wander from faith.

The prodigal son wandered, but the father never stopped watching, never stopped hoping, and ran to embrace his returning son. Some children wander despite faithful parenting.

If your child wanders: keep praying, keep the door open, maintain relationship without enabling sin, and trust God''s pursuing love. The story isn''t over until it''s over. Today we find hope for wandering children.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed prodigals. Today we examine single parenting—unique challenges and God''s sufficiency.

Single parents carry double loads. It''s exhausting. But God is "a father to the fatherless" (Psalm 68:5). He promises to help the vulnerable.

Practical helps: accept assistance from church family, prioritize what matters most, release guilt about what you can''t do, and trust God to fill gaps. Today we honor single parents and explore resources for their journey.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed single parenting. Today we explore blended families—unique complexities and opportunities.

Blended families face challenges: loyalty conflicts, step-parent authority, different family cultures, and complicated logistics. These are real and difficult.

Wisdom includes: patience (blending takes time), realistic expectations, honoring biological parents, building new traditions, and prioritizing the marriage at the center. Today we navigate blended family dynamics.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored parenting: stewardship, faith transmission, discipline, instruction, modeling, developmental stages, protection, releasing, prayer, prodigals, single parenting, and blended families.

"Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him" (Psalm 127:3). They''re gifts—challenging, delightful, exhausting gifts.

As you complete this study, what has encouraged you? What changes will you make? Parenting is hard; God''s grace is sufficient. Raise your children for His glory.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined our identity as saints. Today we explore another truth: we are new creations.

"If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17). You''re not the same person you were. Something genuinely new has been created.

This isn''t self-improvement but supernatural recreation. The old nature died with Christ; a new nature was born. Today we embrace our newness rather than being defined by our old selves.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined new creation identity. Today we explore being God''s workmanship—His masterpiece.

"We are God''s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do" (Ephesians 2:10). "Handiwork" (Greek: poiema) gives us our word "poem." You''re God''s artwork.

You''re not an accident, mistake, or afterthought. You were deliberately crafted by the Master Artist for specific purposes. Today we receive our identity as intentionally made masterpieces.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored being God''s workmanship. Today we examine being members of Christ''s body—connected to each other.

"Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it" (1 Corinthians 12:27). Your identity is corporate as well as individual. You belong to something larger.

This means: you''re needed (every part matters), you''re connected (not meant for isolation), and your gifts serve others (not just yourself). Today we embrace our place in the body.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored body membership. Today we examine being citizens of heaven—our ultimate nationality.

"Our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ" (Philippians 3:20). We''re strangers and aliens on earth; our real home is elsewhere.

Heavenly citizenship means: earth''s values aren''t ultimate; temporary losses don''t define us; and our future is secure regardless of present circumstances. Today we live as citizens of heaven temporarily stationed on earth.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored heavenly citizenship. Today we examine being Christ''s ambassadors—representing Him here.

"We are therefore Christ''s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us" (2 Corinthians 5:20). Ambassadors represent their king in foreign territory. That''s us.

This means: we speak for Christ, we represent His interests, and our conduct reflects on Him. It''s high honor and serious responsibility. Today we embrace our ambassadorial identity.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored being ambassadors. Today we examine being more than conquerors—victory is ours.

"In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us" (Romans 8:37). Not just conquerors but "more than." Not just surviving but thriving. Not just winning but dominating through Christ.

This identity faces trials differently. We''re not victims but victors. Challenges don''t threaten our identity; they reveal it. Today we face difficulty as those who''ve already won.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored being conquerors. Today we examine being friends of Jesus—remarkable intimacy.

"I no longer call you servants... Instead, I have called you friends" (John 15:15). Jesus doesn''t just tolerate us; He enjoys us. Not servants only but friends.

Servants obey; friends commune. Servants know commands; friends know hearts. Jesus shares with us what the Father has told Him. Today we embrace the friendship Jesus offers.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored being Jesus'' friends. Today we examine being co-heirs with Christ—sharing His inheritance.

"Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17). Everything Jesus inherits, we share. The Father''s entire estate belongs to us too.

This is almost too good to believe. But it''s stated clearly. We share Christ''s inheritance—all of it. Today we receive the staggering truth of our inheritance.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored being co-heirs. Today we address identity attacks—the enemy''s strategy against who we are.

Satan attacked Jesus'' identity in the wilderness: "If you are the Son of God..." (Matthew 4:3). He attacks ours too: "You''re not really saved." "God doesn''t love you." "You''re worthless."

Defense requires knowing truth so well that lies are immediately recognized. When identity attacks come, counter with Scripture: "I am who God says I am." Today we prepare for identity warfare.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored identity in Christ: children, adopted, saints, new creations, masterpieces, body members, citizens, ambassadors, conquerors, friends, and co-heirs. We''ve addressed attacks on identity.

"You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God''s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light" (1 Peter 2:9).

As you complete this study, which identity truths most impact you? How will you live differently knowing who you are? You are who God says you are. Live it.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined the Spirit''s sanctifying work. Today we explore the Spirit''s gifts—supernatural abilities for service.

"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them... Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good" (1 Corinthians 12:4, 7). Every believer is gifted for the body''s benefit.

Gifts include wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discernment, tongues, and interpretation (1 Corinthians 12:8-10). Different lists appear elsewhere, suggesting these are representative, not exhaustive. Today we explore spiritual gifts.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined spiritual gifts. Today we explore the fruit of the Spirit—character produced by His presence.

"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control" (Galatians 5:22-23). Note: fruit (singular)—these are one package, not a buffet.

Fruit differs from gifts: gifts are given; fruit is grown. We don''t choose our gifts; fruit develops through abiding. Today we examine whether Spirit-fruit is increasingly evident in our lives.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored the fruit. Today we examine being led by the Spirit—divine guidance for daily life.

"Those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God" (Romans 8:14). Being Spirit-led is normative Christianity, not exceptional experience.

The Spirit leads through: Scripture (He never contradicts His Word), impressions (internal promptings), circumstances (doors opening and closing), counsel (wisdom from others), and peace (or its absence). Today we practice sensitivity to the Spirit''s leading.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored being Spirit-led. Today we examine being filled with the Spirit—ongoing empowerment.

"Be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18). The command is continuous: "keep being filled." This isn''t one-time event but ongoing reality.

Filling involves: surrendering control (the word implies being controlled by), confessing sin that grieves Him, and actively relying on His power. We don''t earn filling; we receive it by faith. Today we seek fresh filling.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored being filled. Today we examine the Spirit''s empowerment for witness.

"You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8). The Spirit''s power is particularly for mission. Pentecost produced proclamation.

This power enables: boldness when we''d naturally fear, words when we''d naturally be speechless, and effectiveness when we''d naturally fail. The Spirit makes ordinary people extraordinary witnesses. Today we rely on the Spirit for witness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored witness empowerment. Today we examine the Spirit''s intercession—He prays for us.

"The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans" (Romans 8:26). When we can''t pray, He prays through us.

This means prayer is never hopeless. Even when words fail, the Spirit interprets our groans and presents them perfectly to the Father. Today we take comfort in the Spirit''s intercession.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored the Spirit''s intercession. Today we examine not grieving the Spirit—maintaining relationship.

"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption" (Ephesians 4:30). The Spirit can be grieved—hurt by our sin. He''s a person, not a force.

What grieves Him? The context lists: lying, anger, stealing, unwholesome talk, bitterness, rage, slander. When we sin, we grieve the One who dwells within. Today we commit to not grieving our divine Guest.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed grieving the Spirit. Today we examine not quenching the Spirit—allowing Him to work.

"Do not quench the Spirit" (1 Thessalonians 5:19). The image is of fire—we can suppress what the Spirit wants to do. Quenching resists His work.

We quench by: ignoring His promptings, refusing to use gifts, dismissing prophecy without testing, and preferring control over surrender. Today we commit to letting the Spirit move freely.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed quenching the Spirit. Today we examine walking in the Spirit—moment-by-moment dependence.

"Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Galatians 5:16). Walking implies ongoing movement—step by step, moment by moment, depending on the Spirit.

Walking in the Spirit means: staying connected throughout the day, making small decisions by His guidance, and maintaining awareness of His presence. It''s not spectacular but faithful. Today we practice walking.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored the Spirit: His person, deity, salvation work, sanctification, gifts, fruit, leading, filling, witness empowerment, intercession, grieving, quenching, and walking.

"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Corinthians 13:14). Fellowship—shared life—with the Spirit.

As you complete this study, how will you relate to the Holy Spirit differently? What changes will you make? He''s not distant deity but present Person. Live in fellowship with Him.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Nebuchadnezzar''s humbling. Today we meet a new king and a new crisis: Belshazzar''s feast and the writing on the wall.

Belshazzar threw a party using sacred vessels from Jerusalem''s temple. A hand appeared and wrote on the wall. The king''s face "turned pale... his knees knocked together" (Daniel 5:6). No one could interpret—except Daniel.

The message: "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin"—numbered, weighed, divided. That night Belshazzar was killed. Pride before the God of heaven leads to destruction. Today we see God''s judgment on presumption.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 witnessed Belshazzar''s fall. Today we enter the lions'' den—perhaps Daniel''s most famous story.

Now under Darius, Daniel''s excellence provoked jealousy. Enemies manipulated the king into decreeing death for anyone praying to any god except the king. Daniel "went home... and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before" (Daniel 6:10).

Note: "just as he had done before." Daniel didn''t start praying because of the crisis or stop because of the danger. He continued what was already his practice. Today we examine the consistency that sustained Daniel.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 entered the lions'' den. Today we witness Daniel''s deliverance and its impact.

"My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions" (Daniel 6:22). The same lions that destroyed Daniel''s accusers couldn''t touch him. Darius issued a decree: "People must fear and reverence the God of Daniel."

Daniel''s faithfulness didn''t just save him—it testified to the watching world. Pagan kings repeatedly acknowledged the true God because of Daniel''s witness. Today we see how personal faithfulness produces public testimony.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw Daniel''s deliverance. Today we shift from narrative to apocalyptic: Daniel''s vision of four beasts (chapter 7).

Four great beasts rise from the sea—representing successive empires. Then "one like a son of man" approaches the Ancient of Days and receives everlasting dominion. Jesus frequently called Himself "Son of Man," drawing on this vision.

Daniel was "troubled in spirit" (7:15) and "deeply troubled" (7:28) by this vision. Apocalyptic visions often disturbed recipients even while providing hope. Today we encounter Daniel''s prophetic visions.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 introduced apocalyptic visions. Today we examine the ram and goat vision (chapter 8)—remarkably specific prophecy.

A ram with two horns (Media-Persia) is defeated by a goat with one horn (Greece/Alexander). The goat''s horn breaks; four arise (Alexander''s generals). From one comes a "little horn" who desecrates the sanctuary—fulfilled in Antiochus Epiphanes.

This prophecy was so accurate that critics claimed it must have been written after the events. But predictive prophecy is exactly what we''d expect from an all-knowing God. Today we marvel at prophetic precision.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 examined the ram and goat. Today we witness Daniel''s prayer of confession (chapter 9)—one of Scripture''s great prayers.

Reading Jeremiah''s prophecy of 70 years, Daniel prayed for his people''s restoration. His prayer includes: acknowledging sin, appealing to God''s character, and asking for mercy not based on Israel''s righteousness but God''s.

"We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy" (Daniel 9:18). This is the posture for all prayer: not deserving but depending on mercy. Today we learn to pray like Daniel.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 examined Daniel''s prayer. Today we explore the seventy "sevens" (Daniel 9:24-27)—one of Scripture''s most debated prophecies.

Gabriel reveals a timeline: seventy "sevens" until the Anointed One comes. Various interpretations exist, but most see reference to Christ''s first coming (some to His second). The precision—predicted hundreds of years in advance—amazes.

Different Christians interpret details differently, but all agree: God has a plan, it unfolds on His timetable, and Messiah is central. Today we engage this complex prophecy with humility and wonder.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored the seventy sevens. Today we examine Daniel''s final vision (chapters 10-12)—spiritual warfare and future conflict.

Daniel''s prayer was heard immediately, but the answer was delayed by spiritual conflict: "The prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days" (Daniel 10:13). Earthly events have spiritual dimensions.

The vision details conflicts between north and south (historically: Seleucids and Ptolemies), culminating in "a time of distress such as has not happened" (12:1). Yet the end brings resurrection and reward. Today we glimpse the spiritual realm.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 examined Daniel''s final vision. Today we explore Daniel''s character—what made him the man he was.

Daniel''s distinctives: unwavering conviction (resolved not to defile himself), consistent prayer (three times daily for decades), humble dependence (always gave God credit), courage under pressure (spoke truth to kings), and long-term faithfulness (served for 70+ years).

He was "highly esteemed" (Daniel 10:11) by heaven. Today we examine which of Daniel''s qualities we need to cultivate.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Daniel: his early resolve, Nebuchadnezzar''s dreams, the furnace, the lions'' den, apocalyptic visions, and his exceptional character.

"Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever" (Daniel 12:3).

As you complete this study, what from Daniel''s life challenges you? What vision encourages you? How will you live with Daniel-like faithfulness in your Babylon? Stand firm—the Ancient of Days is sovereign.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the Spirit''s sanctifying work. Today we examine specific guidance—how does the Spirit lead?

"Those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God" (Romans 8:14). But how? Through Scripture (He never contradicts His Word), promptings, circumstances, counsel, and peace.

Leading isn''t always dramatic; often it''s quiet conviction or gentle direction. Today we grow in sensitivity to His leading.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored guidance. Today we examine the Spirit and prayer—He helps us pray.

"The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us" (Romans 8:26). When words fail, He prays.

Spirit-led prayer follows His prompts, prays Scripture, and rests in His intercession. Today we pray in the Spirit.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored prayer. Today we examine the Spirit and Scripture—He illuminates truth.

"The Spirit will guide you into all the truth" (John 16:13). The Spirit who inspired Scripture also illuminates it. He opens minds to understand.

Spirit-led reading asks for His help, expects Him to teach, and responds to what He reveals. Today we read with Spirit-reliance.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Scripture illumination. Today we examine the Spirit and witness—He empowers testimony.

"You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8). Boldness, words, effectiveness—all Spirit-provided.

Spirit-led witness follows His prompts, speaks His words, and trusts Him with results. Today we witness in Spirit-power.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored witness. Today we examine the Spirit and community—He distributes gifts for the body.

"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them... for the common good" (1 Corinthians 12:4, 7). Every believer is gifted; every gift serves others.

Spirit-led community uses gifts for blessing, not showing off. Today we discover and deploy our gifts.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored gifts. Today we examine walking in the Spirit—moment-by-moment dependence.

"Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Galatians 5:16). Walking implies: ongoing movement, each step dependent, consistent direction.

Spirit-walking is daily, hourly awareness and dependence. Today we practice Spirit-walking.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored walking. Today we address not grieving the Spirit—He can be hurt.

"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God" (Ephesians 4:30). The context mentions: lying, anger, stealing, unwholesome talk, bitterness, rage. These grieve Him.

The Spirit is a Person who feels. Our sin hurts Him. Today we commit to not grieving our Guest.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed grieving. Today we examine not quenching the Spirit—letting Him work.

"Do not quench the Spirit" (1 Thessalonians 5:19). The image is fire—we can suppress what He wants to do. Quenching resists His promptings.

Spirit-led living allows Him freedom, follows His prompts, and welcomes His work. Today we stop quenching.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed quenching. Today we examine being filled with the Spirit—ongoing experience.

"Be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18). The command is continuous: keep being filled. This isn''t one-time but ongoing.

Filling involves: surrender, confession, invitation, and faith. Today we seek fresh filling.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored Spirit-led living: His presence, fruit, sanctification, guidance, prayer, Scripture, witness, community, walking, grieving, quenching, and filling.

"Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit" (Galatians 5:25).

As you complete this study, how will you follow the Spirit more closely? He indwells you. Walk with Him.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the promise of provision. Today we examine the promise of wisdom—"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God" (James 1:5).

Hard times require decisions we don''t know how to make. God promises wisdom to those who ask without doubting.

Wisdom isn''t just information but skill for living—knowing what to do when the way isn''t clear. Today we claim wisdom for hard decisions.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored wisdom''s promise. Today we examine the promise of strength—"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13).

This verse isn''t about achieving anything we want but about contentment in any circumstance. Paul wrote from prison about contentment in plenty or want.

Christ strengthens us for whatever we face. Today we receive strength for our situation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored strength''s promise. Today we examine the promise of peace—"My peace I give you" (John 14:27).

Jesus offered peace the world can''t give—peace independent of circumstances. This peace guards hearts and minds (Philippians 4:7).

Turmoil without, peace within. Today we receive the peace Jesus promised.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored peace''s promise. Today we examine the promise of comfort—"God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).

God specializes in comfort. He comforts so we can comfort others with the same comfort we received.

Hard times position us to receive and then give comfort. Today we receive God''s comfort.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored comfort''s promise. Today we examine the promise of purpose—"God works all things together for good" (Romans 8:28).

This doesn''t mean all things are good but that God weaves even bad things into good purposes. The promise is for "those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."

Nothing is wasted in God''s economy. Today we trust His purposeful working.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored purpose''s promise. Today we examine the promise of grace sufficient—"My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Corinthians 12:9).

Paul begged for relief; God offered grace instead. The thorn remained; grace sustained.

Sometimes God removes hardship; sometimes He gives grace to endure it. Today we receive sufficient grace.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored sufficient grace. Today we examine the promise of eventual joy—"Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning" (Psalm 30:5).

Night doesn''t last forever. Morning comes. Tears will give way to joy—if not in this life, certainly in the next.

"He will wipe every tear from their eyes" (Revelation 21:4). Today we hold onto eventual joy.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored eventual joy. Today we examine the promise of eternal perspective—"Our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory" (2 Corinthians 4:17).

Present suffering, however heavy, is "light" compared to eternal glory. Affliction is "momentary" against forever.

Eternal perspective doesn''t minimize present pain but contextualizes it. Today we gain perspective.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored eternal perspective. Today we examine the promise of ultimate victory—"In all these things we are more than conquerors" (Romans 8:37).

Not just survivors but conquerors—more than conquerors. Present hardship doesn''t determine ultimate outcome.

"The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (Romans 16:20). Victory is certain. Today we live as victors.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored promises for hard times: God''s presence, never being forsaken, provision, wisdom, strength, peace, comfort, purpose, sufficient grace, eventual joy, eternal perspective, and ultimate victory.

"Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave" (1 Kings 8:56).

As you complete this study, which promises will you hold onto? God keeps His word. Believe it.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored God meeting us in darkness. Today we examine physical factors—depression isn''t only spiritual.

Elijah was depressed; God''s first prescription was food and sleep (1 Kings 19:5-7). Sometimes spiritual problems have physical components.

Sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, lack of exercise, medical conditions—all can affect mood. Caring for your body is spiritual discipline. Today we address physical factors.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed physical factors. Today we explore the value of community—we need others.

"Carry each other''s burdens" (Galatians 6:2). Depression often isolates; healing often requires connection.

Elijah thought he was alone; he wasn''t. You''re not alone either. Today we push against isolation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored community. Today we address when professional help is needed—wisdom, not weakness.

Depression sometimes indicates clinical conditions requiring medical treatment. Seeking help isn''t failure; it''s wisdom.

God uses counselors, doctors, and medication. Don''t resist help out of false pride. Today we normalize appropriate professional help.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed professional help. Today we explore hope as anchor—holding when everything shakes.

"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure" (Hebrews 6:19). Anchors hold in storms. Hope holds when feelings sink.

Hope isn''t optimism but confidence in God''s character and promises. Today we anchor in hope.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored hope. Today we examine gratitude''s power—it shifts focus.

"Give thanks in all circumstances" (1 Thessalonians 5:18). Not for all circumstances but in them. Gratitude redirects attention from what''s wrong to what''s right.

Gratitude is discipline, not feeling. Today we practice thankfulness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored gratitude. Today we examine truth versus feelings—feelings lie.

Depression distorts perception. Everything looks darker than it is. "There is no hope" feels true but isn''t.

"The heart is deceitful above all things" (Jeremiah 17:9). Trust truth over feelings. Today we align with truth.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed feelings versus truth. Today we explore small steps—progress, not perfection.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Depression makes everything overwhelming. Break it down.

One day at a time. One task at a time. One step at a time. Today we take small steps forward.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored small steps. Today we examine serving others—looking outward helps.

"In humility value others above yourselves" (Philippians 2:3). When we focus on others'' needs, our own pain loses some power.

This isn''t denial but perspective. Serving breaks the inward spiral. Today we consider serving.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored serving. Today we address patience with the process—healing takes time.

"Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord''s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop" (James 5:7). Farmers don''t rush harvest.

Recovery isn''t instant. Progress matters more than pace. Today we practice patience.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored encouragement for depression: biblical examples, God in darkness, physical factors, community, professional help, hope, gratitude, truth, small steps, serving, and patience.

"The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit" (Psalm 34:18).

As you complete this study, what will you implement? You''re not alone. God is near. There is hope.'

"The God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).

Your suffering isn''t wasted—it becomes ministry equipment. Today we see suffering''s redemptive purpose.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored empathy from suffering. Today we examine Jesus'' suffering—He understands.

"We do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses" (Hebrews 4:15). Jesus suffered: hunger, exhaustion, rejection, betrayal, abandonment, physical torture, death.

He doesn''t observe from distance; He understands from experience. Today we approach One who gets it.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored Jesus'' understanding. Today we examine suffering as identification with Christ—sharing His experience.

"I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings" (Philippians 3:10). Paul saw suffering as fellowship with Christ.

Suffering with Christ connects us to Him in unique ways. Today we reframe suffering as connection.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored identification with Christ. Today we examine present suffering versus future glory—it''s not proportional.

"Our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us" (Romans 8:18). Present pain, however intense, is outweighed by coming glory.

Eternal perspective doesn''t minimize present pain but contextualizes it. Today we weigh suffering against glory.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored glory outweighing suffering. Today we examine lament as worship—bringing pain to God honestly.

The Psalms overflow with lament: "How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1). Lament is not doubt but faith that brings pain to God.

Honest cries are worship too. Today we bring our pain to God.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored lament. Today we examine God''s sovereignty over suffering—He''s not absent or powerless.

"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:20). God doesn''t cause all suffering, but He sovereignly works through it.

Mystery remains, but so does sovereignty. Today we trust the Sovereign in suffering.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored sovereignty. Today we examine community in suffering—we''re not meant to suffer alone.

"If one part suffers, every part suffers with it" (1 Corinthians 12:26). The body shares pain.

Let others in. Receive help. Share the burden. Today we accept community support.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored community. Today we examine suffering preparing us for eternity—affliction produces glory.

"Our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (2 Corinthians 4:17). Suffering achieves something—it produces eternal weight.

Present pain accomplishes future gain. Today we see suffering''s eternal purpose.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored eternal purpose. Today we examine holding on to hope—it''s anchor in storms.

"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure" (Hebrews 6:19). Hope anchors when circumstances shake.

Hope isn''t wishful thinking but confident expectation based on God''s character and promises. Today we anchor in hope.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored hope in suffering: suffering''s reality, purpose, and path, character development, empathy, Jesus'' understanding, identification with Christ, glory comparison, lament, sovereignty, community, eternal purpose, and hope.

"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair" (2 Corinthians 4:8).

As you complete this study, how has your perspective on suffering shifted? Hold onto hope. Glory is coming.'

"Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist" (Ephesians 6:14). Roman soldiers tucked garments into belts; without them, they''d trip. Truth holds everything together.

Satan is the father of lies (John 8:44). Truth exposes lies. Today we put on truth.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored truth. Today we examine the breastplate of righteousness—protecting the heart.

"With the breastplate of righteousness in place" (Ephesians 6:14). The breastplate protected vital organs. Righteousness protects our hearts from accusation.

This is Christ''s righteousness credited to us and practical righteousness in daily living. Both protect. Today we wear righteousness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored righteousness. Today we examine feet fitted with gospel readiness—stability and mobility.

"With your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace" (Ephesians 6:15). Roman soldiers wore sandals with spikes for traction.

The gospel gives us firm footing and mobilizes us for mission. Today we stand firm and advance.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored gospel readiness. Today we examine the shield of faith—extinguishing attacks.

"Take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one" (Ephesians 6:16). Roman shields could interlock and be soaked to quench fire arrows.

Doubt, fear, temptation—faith extinguishes them. Today we raise faith''s shield.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored faith. Today we examine the helmet of salvation—protecting the mind.

"Take the helmet of salvation" (Ephesians 6:17). Helmets protect heads—where thoughts happen.

Knowing we''re saved protects against mental attacks: "You''re not really saved." "God has abandoned you." "You''ve sinned too much." Today we secure our minds with salvation''s assurance.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored salvation''s helmet. Today we examine the sword of the Spirit—the only offensive weapon.

"The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17). Jesus countered Satan''s temptations with "It is written." Scripture is our weapon.

This requires knowing Scripture—you can''t use a sword left at home. Today we sharpen our sword.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored the sword. Today we examine prayer as spiritual warfare—essential to the battle.

"Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests" (Ephesians 6:18). Prayer follows the armor description because prayer deploys the armor.

Armor without prayer is like soldiers without orders. Today we fight through prayer.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored prayer. Today we address how Satan attacks—knowing the enemy.

Satan attacks through: lies (John 8:44), temptation (Matthew 4), accusation (Revelation 12:10), division (1 Corinthians 3:3), and distraction.

Knowing his strategies helps us prepare. Today we recognize attack patterns.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored Satan''s strategies. Today we examine resisting the devil—he flees when we do.

"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). Note the order: submit to God first, then resist Satan.

Resistance isn''t passive but active—speaking truth, praying, refusing to yield. Today we actively resist.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored spiritual warfare: the reality, the enemy, the battle, the armor (truth, righteousness, gospel, faith, salvation, Scripture), prayer, and resistance.

"The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (Romans 16:20).

"In your anger do not sin" (Ephesians 4:26). Conflict isn''t sin; how we handle it matters. Fight fair: address issues, not attack persons.

"A gentle answer turns away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). Today we develop healthy conflict patterns.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed conflict. Today we examine forgiveness in marriage—essential for longevity.

"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone" (Colossians 3:13). Marriage accumulates hurts. Without forgiveness, resentment builds.

Forgiveness is decision, not feeling. Today we practice marital forgiveness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored forgiveness. Today we examine intimacy—physical, emotional, spiritual connection.

"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband" (1 Corinthians 7:3). Sexual intimacy is good, expected, and mutual in marriage.

But intimacy is more than physical—emotional vulnerability and spiritual partnership complete the picture. Today we pursue full intimacy.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored intimacy. Today we examine seasons of marriage—it changes over time.

Newlywed passion, parenting exhaustion, empty-nest adjustment, aging together—each season has unique challenges and gifts.

"There is a time for everything" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Today we navigate or anticipate marriage seasons.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored seasons. Today we examine protecting marriage—it faces real threats.

Threats include: neglect, outside attractions, busyness, in-law issues, and financial stress. Marriage requires intentional protection.

"Above all else, guard your heart" (Proverbs 4:23). Today we identify and address threats.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored protection. Today we examine serving each other—marriage as mutual ministry.

"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Ephesians 5:21). Before specific role instructions, mutual submission is called for.

Servant marriage asks "How can I serve?" not "What do I get?" Today we cultivate servant hearts.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored serving. Today we examine praying together—spiritual partnership.

"Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives... so that nothing will hinder your prayers" (1 Peter 3:7). Marriage and prayer are connected.

Couples who pray together report stronger marriages. Today we pray with our spouses.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored praying together. Today we examine growing together—becoming better together.

"Two are better than one" (Ecclesiastes 4:9). Healthy marriages make both partners better.

Growing together requires: shared goals, mutual encouragement, honest feedback, and celebrating each other''s growth. Today we evaluate—growing together or apart?',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored growing together. Today we examine legacy—what your marriage passes on.

Your marriage teaches children what marriage looks like. It witnesses to the watching world. It either commends or undermines the gospel picture it represents.

"Grandchildren are the crown of the aged" (Proverbs 17:6). Today we consider multi-generational impact.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored biblical love and marriage: God''s design, love''s portrait, roles, communication, conflict, forgiveness, intimacy, seasons, protection, serving, praying, growing, and legacy.

"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" (1 Corinthians 11:1). Can you say this to your children?

Children absorb what they see. If we want praying children, they must see us pray. If we want honest children, they must hear us tell truth. Today we examine what our lives teach.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored modeling. Today we examine age-appropriate parenting—children are not mini-adults.

"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child" (1 Corinthians 13:11). Expectations and methods should fit developmental stages.

Toddlers need different parenting than teenagers. Today we adapt to developmental realities.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed developmental stages. Today we examine protection—keeping children safe.

"If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck" (Matthew 18:6). Children need protection.

Protection includes: monitoring media, screening relationships, creating safe home environments, and teaching discernment. Today we assess protective practices.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored protection. Today we examine releasing—the goal is launch.

"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother" (Genesis 2:24). Leaving is the goal. We raise children to leave well.

This requires progressively releasing control, allowing age-appropriate decisions and consequences, and preparing for independence. Today we balance holding and releasing.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored releasing. Today we examine praying for children—our most important practice.

Job regularly offered sacrifices for his children "thinking, ''Perhaps my children have sinned''" (Job 1:5). Covering children in prayer was his custom.

We can''t control their choices, but we can pray. Today we develop prayer habits for our children.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored prayer. Today we address prodigals—when children wander.

The prodigal''s father never stopped watching, hoping, and waiting. Some children wander despite faithful parenting.

Keep praying, keep the door open, maintain relationship without enabling sin. The story isn''t over until it''s over. Today we find hope for wandering children.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed prodigals. Today we examine encouragement—building up children.

"Fathers, do not exasperate your children" (Ephesians 6:4). Constant criticism, unrealistic expectations, and comparison exasperate.

"Encourage one another daily" (Hebrews 3:13). Children flourish with encouragement. Today we build up our children.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored encouragement. Today we examine consistency—children need predictability.

"Let your ''Yes'' be yes, and your ''No,'' no" (James 5:12). Follow-through matters. Inconsistent boundaries confuse.

Consistency in rules, consequences, and affection creates security. Today we pursue consistent parenting.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored consistency. Today we address special circumstances—single parents, blended families, special needs.

Not every family looks the same. Single parents carry double loads. Blended families navigate complexity. Special needs require adaptation.

God is "a father to the fatherless" (Psalm 68:5). He helps the vulnerable. Today we acknowledge diverse family realities.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored parenting: stewardship, faith transmission, discipline, instruction, modeling, developmental stages, protection, releasing, prayer, prodigals, encouragement, consistency, and special circumstances.

Nehemiah communicated simply: "You see the trouble we are in... Come, let us rebuild." Response: "Let us start rebuilding" (Nehemiah 2:17-18). Clear communication produces united action.

Good communication includes clarity, inspiration, and repetition. Today we develop communication skills.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined communication. Today we explore decision-making—leaders face constant choices.

Moses was advised to delegate decisions, handling only difficult cases himself (Exodus 18:22). Wise leaders know what to decide and what to delegate.

Decision wisdom includes: gathering information, seeking counsel, praying, and acting decisively. Today we develop decision processes.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored decisions. Today we examine handling criticism—it comes with leadership.

Moses faced constant criticism. David was mocked. Jesus was slandered. Leaders attract criticism.

Listen for legitimate concerns, ignore unfounded attacks, maintain focus. "A gentle answer turns away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). Today we build resilience.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed criticism. Today we explore developing others—leaders multiply themselves.

Jesus invested three years in twelve. Paul invested in Timothy, Titus, and others. Good leaders develop future leaders.

"The things you have heard me say... entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Today we commit to developing others.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined development. Today we explore leading change—it''s always challenging.

Nehemiah led change against opposition. Change produces resistance; leaders must navigate it.

Change leadership includes: communicating why change is necessary, involving people, addressing concerns, and maintaining patience. Today we develop change leadership skills.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored change. Today we examine self-leadership—leading yourself first.

"I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified" (1 Corinthians 9:27). Self-leadership precedes public leadership.

Self-leadership includes: time management, maintaining disciplines, guarding heart, and resting appropriately. Today we assess self-leadership.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored self-leadership. Today we address crisis leadership—when everything goes wrong.

Nehemiah faced crisis: enemies threatened, workers despaired. His response: "Remember the Lord... and fight" (Nehemiah 4:14). Prayer and action.

Crisis leadership requires: staying calm, communicating clearly, making decisions, and maintaining hope. Today we prepare for crisis.',

Moses invested in Joshua. Elijah mentored Elisha. Paul developed Timothy. Leaders who don''t plan succession leave vacuums.

"Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). Vision needs successors. Today we plan for succession.',

Discovering purpose involves discovering gifts. What abilities has the Spirit given you? Today we identify spiritual gifts.',

Nehemiah wept over Jerusalem''s walls. Paul agonized over his kinsmen''s salvation. God-given passion often points to purpose.

What moves you? What injustice angers you? What need compels you? Today we identify holy passions.',

Joseph''s suffering prepared him to save Egypt. Moses'' wilderness years prepared him to lead through wilderness. Your experiences equip you.

What has life taught you? What have you survived? How might that serve others? Today we see experience as preparation.',

Some pursue: success (achievement measured by worldly standards), approval (living for others'' opinions), comfort (avoiding discomfort), or control (managing outcomes).

These counterfeit purposes distract from real ones. Today we identify false purposes.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed false purposes. Today we explore purpose and seasons—it changes over time.

Moses'' purpose looked different at 40 than at 80. David''s calling shifted from shepherd to warrior to king. Purpose has seasons.

"There is a time for everything" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). What is your purpose in this season? Today we embrace seasonal purpose.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored seasons. Today we address obstacles to purpose—what holds us back.

Fear says "What if I fail?" Comparison says "They''re better." Past failure says "You already blew it." Busyness says "No time."

"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13). Today we confront obstacles.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 confronted obstacles. Today we examine living purpose daily—translating calling to calendar.

Purpose isn''t just big picture but daily decisions. How does purpose shape your Monday? Your spending? Your relationships?

"Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). Today we connect purpose to practice.',

This gift isn''t glamorous but essential. Today we honor and identify serving gifts.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored serving. Today we examine teaching gifts—explaining truth clearly.

"If it is teaching, then teach" (Romans 12:7). Teachers take complex truth and make it understandable. They love accuracy and clarity.

"Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly" (James 3:1). Today we examine teaching gifts.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored teaching. Today we examine encouraging gifts—strengthening others.

"If it is to encourage, then give encouragement" (Romans 12:8). Encouragers see potential, speak hope, and lift spirits.

Barnabas means "son of encouragement" (Acts 4:36). He encouraged the early church, sponsored Paul, and restored Mark. Today we honor encouragement gifts.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored encouragement. Today we examine giving gifts—generosity that flows freely.

"If it is giving, then give generously" (Romans 12:8). Some have unusual capacity for generosity—they see needs and have ability and willingness to meet them.

Giving gifts fund ministry. Today we honor and examine giving gifts.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored giving. Today we examine leadership gifts—governing with diligence.

"If it is to lead, do it diligently" (Romans 12:8). Some have capacity to organize, direct, and mobilize others toward goals.

Leadership gifts require character alongside capacity. Today we examine leadership gifts.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored leadership. Today we examine mercy gifts—showing compassion.

"If it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully" (Romans 12:8). Mercy sees suffering and responds with compassion—not duty but genuine care.

Mercy gifts often minister to the overlooked—sick, grieving, marginalized. Today we honor mercy gifts.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored mercy. Today we examine more dramatic gifts—prophecy, tongues, healing.

"To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge... to another faith... to another gifts of healing, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues" (1 Corinthians 12:8-10).

Christians disagree about how these gifts function today. Today we examine them with humility.',

Clues include: what do you enjoy doing? What bears fruit? What do others affirm? What opportunities keep arising?

Spiritual gift inventories can help, but real ministry reveals real gifts. Today we pursue gift discovery.',

"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God''s grace" (1 Peter 4:10). Gifts unused are stewardship failed.

Jesus "went through all the towns and villages" (Matthew 9:35). He didn''t wait for people to come; He went. Mission requires proximity.

Where do you have proximity to people who need the gospel? Work, neighborhood, gym, school? Today we see existing relationships as mission fields.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored proximity. Today we examine preparation—being ready to share.

"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have" (1 Peter 3:15). Preparation means knowing your story and the gospel.

Can you explain the gospel simply? Can you share your testimony briefly? Today we prepare.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored preparation. Today we examine prayer for the lost—spiritual work precedes visible results.

"The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field" (Matthew 9:37-38). Jesus said pray; then He sent.

Prayer opens hearts, creates opportunities, and empowers witness. Today we pray for the lost.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored prayer. Today we examine proclamation—at some point, the gospel must be spoken.

"How can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" (Romans 10:14). Living well isn''t enough—words matter.

This doesn''t require pulpits, just conversations. Today we overcome silence.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored proclamation. Today we examine presence—being with people over time.

Jesus didn''t just preach; He ate with sinners, attended their parties, spent time in their spaces. Presence builds trust.

Mission isn''t drive-by evangelism but relational investment. Today we commit to presence.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored presence. Today we examine demonstration—good works that open doors.

"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Visible good creates curiosity.

Service, justice, compassion—all can be gospel demonstrations. Today we demonstrate kingdom reality.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored demonstration. Today we address fear—it''s the primary barrier.

"Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you" (Acts 18:9-10). God told Paul: don''t let fear silence you.

What do you fear? Rejection? Inadequacy? Awkwardness? Today we address fear with faith.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed fear. Today we examine disciple-making—not just converts but disciples.

"Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them... and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20). The goal is disciples, not decisions.

Disciples require investment over time. Today we commit to disciple-making.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored disciple-making. Today we examine multiplication—disciples who make disciples.

"The things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Four generations in one verse.

Mission multiplies through reproduction. Today we think beyond addition to multiplication.',

Wisdom considers: consequences, counsel, character development. Today we apply wisdom to decisions.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored wisdom. Today we examine peace as guide—internal confirmation.

"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts" (Colossians 3:15). "Rule" means "umpire"—peace arbitrates decisions.

When considering options, where do you have peace? Peace doesn''t guarantee ease but often indicates alignment. Today we attend to peace.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored peace. Today we examine open doors—circumstances as guidance.

"I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut" (Revelation 3:8). Sometimes God guides through opportunity or closed doors.

Open doors invite; closed doors redirect. Today we read circumstances wisely.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored circumstances. Today we examine counsel—others'' wisdom.

"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" (Proverbs 15:22). Wise counselors see what we might miss.

Seek counsel from mature believers who know you and know Scripture. Today we pursue wise counsel.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored counsel. Today we examine desires—God shapes them.

"Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart" (Psalm 37:4). As we delight in God, He shapes desires.

What do you want? If you''re walking with God, desires may be guidance. Today we examine desires.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored desires. Today we address paralysis—fear of making wrong choices.

Some people are paralyzed by fear of missing God''s will. But God doesn''t play hide-and-seek with guidance.

"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault" (James 1:5). He wants you to know more than you want to know. Today we overcome paralysis.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed paralysis. Today we examine making decisions—at some point, decide.

After prayer, counsel, and consideration, decide. "Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans" (Proverbs 16:3).

Indecision is itself a decision. Step forward; trust God to direct. Today we learn to decide.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored deciding. Today we address changing course—what if you chose wrong?

God can redirect. "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps" (Proverbs 16:9). Wrong turns become right when God redirects.

You can''t out-choose God''s sovereignty. Today we release fear of wrong choices.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed wrong choices. Today we explore daily will—God''s will for today.

"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own" (Matthew 6:34). What is God''s will for today?

Obey today. Trust tomorrow to God. Today we focus on today''s will.',

Revelation describes seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments. Christians interpret these differently (literal/symbolic, future/historical). Today we examine tribulation texts.',

"The man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).

Scripture describes an ultimate opponent of Christ who deceives many. Today we examine antichrist passages.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored the antichrist. Today we examine Israel''s role—what about the Jewish people?

"All Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26). Paul describes partial hardening on Israel until full Gentile inclusion, then Israel''s salvation.

Christians disagree about details, but Israel has a place in God''s plan. Today we examine Israel''s future.',

"This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). He left visibly; He''ll return visibly.

"Every eye will see him" (Revelation 1:7). Today we anticipate Christ''s return.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Christ''s return. Today we examine the millennium—Christ''s thousand-year reign.

"They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years" (Revelation 20:4). Christians disagree: Is this a literal future period (premillennialism), present spiritual reality (amillennialism), or golden age before Christ''s return (postmillennialism)?

Today we survey millennium views.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored millennium views. Today we examine final judgment—every person will give account.

"We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body" (2 Corinthians 5:10).

"The dead were judged according to what they had done" (Revelation 20:12). Today we face judgment reality.',

Hell is sobering reality that motivates mission. Today we take hell seriously.',

"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth... God''s dwelling place is now among the people" (Revelation 21:1-3). God will make all things new.

Heaven isn''t escape from earth but earth renewed—resurrection bodies in renewed creation. Today we anticipate our future home.',

"Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God" (2 Peter 3:11-12).

Mark clusters these mighty works to answer: Who is Jesus? Today we see His authority displayed.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 witnessed miracles. Today we see rejection in Nazareth—familiarity breeds contempt.

"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town" (Mark 6:4). Those who knew Him longest believed Him least. "He could not do any miracles there" (6:5)—not couldn''t but wouldn''t, due to unbelief.

Jesus sent the Twelve with His authority. Today we see mission extending beyond His physical presence.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed rejection and mission. Today we see the feeding of the five thousand—abundance from scarcity.

Five loaves, two fish, five thousand men plus women and children—twelve baskets left over. "They all ate and were satisfied" (Mark 6:42).

Mark is setting up understanding: Jesus provides, but disciples are slow to grasp. Today we see abundant provision.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed feeding. Today Jesus walks on water and disciples'' hearts remain hard.

"They were completely amazed, for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened" (Mark 6:51-52). Despite miracles, they don''t understand.

This theme intensifies: Jesus reveals; disciples struggle. Today we examine our own slow understanding.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 exposed hard hearts. Today Peter confesses Jesus as Christ—the Gospel''s turning point.

"Who do you say I am?" Peter answered: "You are the Messiah" (Mark 8:29). The pivotal confession.

Immediately Jesus predicted His death and rebuked Peter for opposing it. The Christ must suffer. Today we reach Mark''s theological center.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 witnessed Peter''s confession. Today Jesus is transfigured—glory revealed to inner circle.

"His clothes became dazzling white" (Mark 9:3). Moses and Elijah appeared. God spoke: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!" (9:7).

Coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed silence until resurrection. Today we glimpse glory before suffering.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 witnessed transfiguration. Today Jesus heads toward Jerusalem—passion predictions intensify.

Three times Jesus predicted His death (8:31, 9:31, 10:33-34). Three times disciples missed the point. The journey to Jerusalem is journey to the cross.

"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit?... You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).

Sexual sin uniquely sins against one''s own body. Today we receive the call to bodily holiness.',

Corinthian worship was chaotic. Paul addresses propriety in head coverings (culturally specific?) and serious abuse of the Lord''s Supper—some gorged while others went hungry.

"When you come together, it is not the Lord''s Supper you eat" (1 Corinthians 11:20). Today we examine worship order.',

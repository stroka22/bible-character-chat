-- GROWING WHEN STUCK
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored serving others as growth catalyst. Today we examine another remedy: fresh encounter with Scripture.

When spiritually stuck, return to basics: "Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation" (1 Peter 2:2). Sometimes we need milk again before returning to meat.

Try a different approach: a new translation, audio Bible, devotional guide, or systematic reading plan. Read expectantly—ask God to speak. Journal insights. Memorize passages. Sometimes spiritual dryness results from abandoned disciplines. Today we recommit to Scripture engagement.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed fresh Scripture encounter. Today we explore worship as breakthrough—praise that shifts perspective.

Paul and Silas, beaten and imprisoned, prayed and sang hymns at midnight (Acts 16:25). Their circumstances didn''t change (yet), but their perspective did. Worship refocuses attention from problems to God.

When stuck, worship anyway. Sing even if you don''t feel like it. Praise God for who He is regardless of how you feel. "Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise" (Psalm 100:4). The sacrifice of praise often precedes the sense of His presence. Today we worship our way through stuckness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined worship as breakthrough. Today we address a possible cause: unconfessed sin blocking growth.

"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened" (Psalm 66:18). Unconfessed sin creates distance. Spiritual stagnation sometimes signals hidden rebellion.

Ask the Spirit to search your heart (Psalm 139:23-24). What have you been avoiding? What rationalizations have you made? What commands are you ignoring? Confession clears the channel for grace to flow again. Today we invite the searchlight of the Spirit into dark corners.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined unconfessed sin. Today we explore seasons: not all spiritual dryness indicates problems.

Even healthy plants have dormant seasons. Spiritual winter can prepare for spring growth. "I will not always accuse, nor will I harbor my anger forever" (Isaiah 57:16). God knows seasons vary.

Some dryness results from: emotional exhaustion, physical depletion, overwhelming circumstances, or God''s intentional hiddenness to strengthen faith. The key: keep seeking, keep obeying, keep trusting—even when feeling nothing. Today we normalize seasons while not using them as excuses.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 normalized spiritual seasons. Today we address another remedy: getting outside yourself through generosity.

"One person gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty" (Proverbs 11:24). Counter-intuitively, giving when we feel empty can bring filling.

Generosity with money, time, energy, and attention breaks the inward spiral of self-focus. We discover that we have more to give than we thought. And in giving, we often receive. Today we practice generosity as a pathway through spiritual stagnation.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored: spiritual friendship, serving others, fresh Scripture engagement, worship, confession, recognizing seasons, and generosity. Today we commit to implementing what we''ve learned.

"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up" (Galatians 6:9). The promise is conditional: we reap if we don''t give up.

As you complete this study, which remedies will you apply? Make a specific plan: which friend will you pursue? What service will you offer? How will you engage Scripture freshly? Don''t stay stuck—take action and trust God for breakthrough.'
WHERE slug = 'growing-when-stuck';

-- PATIENCE, PERSEVERANCE, ENDURANCE
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined endurance for the long haul. Today we explore waiting on God—active patience that trusts His timing.

"Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD" (Psalm 27:14). Biblical waiting isn''t passive resignation but active expectation. It''s not giving up but holding on.

Abraham waited twenty-five years for Isaac. Joseph waited thirteen years from dreams to throne. Israel waited four hundred years in Egypt. God''s timing rarely matches ours—but it''s always perfect. "He has made everything beautiful in its time" (Ecclesiastes 3:11). Today we practice expectant waiting.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored waiting on God. Today we examine what perseverance produces: proven character.

"We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope" (Romans 5:3-4). Perseverance isn''t just endurance for its own sake; it''s forming something in us.

Character developed through difficulty is tested character—reliable, proven, trustworthy. It can''t be developed any other way. The shortcut-culture wants results without process, but God grows character through time and testing. Today we embrace the process.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined character development. Today we explore perseverance''s inspiration: the example of Jesus.

"Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart" (Hebrews 12:3). Jesus is our model for endurance. He faced rejection, misunderstanding, betrayal, and crucifixion—and endured.

"For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God" (Hebrews 12:2). Joy ahead enabled endurance now. Today we fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 looked to Jesus'' example. Today we examine perseverance''s community: we need each other.

"Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another" (Hebrews 10:25). Isolation kills perseverance; community sustains it.

We need others to: remind us of truth when we forget, encourage us when we flag, hold us accountable when we drift, and share our burdens when they''re heavy. "Two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). Today we invest in perseverance-sustaining community.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 emphasized community. Today we explore perseverance''s perspective: keeping eyes on the finish.

"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness" (2 Timothy 4:7-8). Paul viewed life as a race with a finish line and reward.

How we finish matters more than how we start. Many who began with enthusiasm have dropped out. "Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor''s crown" (Revelation 2:10). Today we set our gaze on the finish.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored patience, perseverance, endurance, waiting, character development, Jesus'' example, community support, and the finish line. Today we commit to running our race.

"Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us" (Hebrews 12:1). Note: the race marked out for us—your race is yours, not someone else''s.

As you complete this study, what threatens your perseverance? What strengthens it? Who runs alongside you? Commit to finishing well. The race is long, but the reward is eternal. Keep running.'
WHERE slug = 'patience-perseverance-endurance';

-- HUMILITY AND OBEDIENCE
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined humility enabling unity. Today we explore humility in success—handling blessing without pride.

"When your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase... then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God" (Deuteronomy 8:13-14). Success is dangerous to humility.

Humble success remembers: "It is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth" (Deuteronomy 8:18). Every good thing is gift. Achievement doesn''t make us superior; it increases stewardship responsibility. Today we practice gratitude that guards against pride in success.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed humility in success. Today we examine humility in failure—learning without being crushed.

Peter failed spectacularly—denying Jesus three times. Yet he was restored and became a pillar of the early church. Failure is humbling; how we respond determines whether it becomes formative or destructive.

Humble failure: acknowledges the wrong without excuse, receives forgiveness without earning it, learns what can be learned, and moves forward without endless self-condemnation. "Though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again" (Proverbs 24:16). Today we practice humble recovery.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined humility in failure. Today we explore obedience when it doesn''t make sense—trusting God''s wisdom over our own.

Abraham was told to sacrifice Isaac—the son of promise. It made no sense. Yet "early the next morning Abraham got up" (Genesis 22:3). He obeyed without recorded argument.

"Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). Sometimes God''s commands seem illogical. Obedience demonstrates trust in His character and wisdom. Today we identify areas where obedience requires trust beyond understanding.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored obedience beyond understanding. Today we examine obedience in small things—faithfulness in the everyday.

"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much" (Luke 16:10). Small obedience prepares for large responsibility. Character is built in minor decisions.

Daily obedience includes: speaking truth in casual conversations, giving generously when amounts seem insignificant, serving when no one notices, and maintaining integrity in small transactions. These "little" acts form the person who can handle bigger tests. Today we commit to small faithfulness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined small obedience. Today we explore the relationship between love and obedience.

"If you love me, keep my commands" (John 14:15). Obedience isn''t opposed to love; it''s love''s expression. Children who love their parents want to please them. We obey not to earn love but because we''ve received it.

"This is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome" (1 John 5:3). When we love God, obedience isn''t grudging duty but glad response. Today we examine whether our obedience flows from love or mere obligation.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored humility in relationship, in success, in failure; and obedience when it''s hard, in small things, and from love. Today we embrace the humble, obedient life.

"What does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). Humble walking with God summarizes faithful living.

As you complete this study, where does pride still lurk? Where does disobedience persist? Humility and obedience aren''t natural—they''re gifts of grace we receive and cultivate. Walk humbly, obey gladly, and watch God work.'
WHERE slug = 'humility-and-obedience';

-- WAITING ON GOD'S TIMING
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined what waiting produces. Today we explore waiting actively—it''s not passive resignation but engaged trust.

"Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him" (Psalm 37:7). "Stillness" isn''t inactivity but ceasing striving. We continue doing what we can while trusting God with what we can''t.

Active waiting includes: continued prayer, faithful obedience in known duties, growing in character, serving others, and maintaining readiness for when God acts. Waiting isn''t hitting pause on life but living fully while trusting God''s timing. Today we practice active waiting.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored active waiting. Today we address waiting''s emotions—what to do when impatience, doubt, or despair arise.

The psalms model honest emotional expression: "How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1). We can bring frustration, confusion, and even anger to God. He''s not threatened by our emotions.

But notice: even psalms of lament usually move toward trust. Express the emotion, then redirect to truth. "But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation" (Psalm 13:5). Today we practice honest emotion that resolves in trust.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed waiting''s emotions. Today we explore examples: people who waited and saw God act.

Hannah waited years for a child, pouring out her anguish to God, until Samuel was granted. David was anointed king as a teenager but didn''t reign until thirty—years of fugitive existence between promise and fulfillment. The early church waited ten days for the Spirit after Jesus ascended.

Their waiting wasn''t wasted—it prepared them for what was coming. God uses waiting to ready us for His answers. Today we draw encouragement from those who waited before us.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined biblical examples. Today we address waiting that doesn''t end as expected—when God''s answer isn''t what we wanted.

Sometimes God says no. Paul prayed three times for his "thorn" to be removed; God said, "My grace is sufficient" (2 Corinthians 12:9). The answer wasn''t removal but sufficiency.

Mature faith trusts God''s wisdom when answers differ from requests. "Your ways are higher than my ways and your thoughts than my thoughts" (Isaiah 55:9). Today we prepare for the possibility that waiting ends differently than we hoped—and God remains good.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed unexpected answers. Today we explore waiting together—community support during seasons of waiting.

"Carry each other''s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2). We need others when waiting is hard—people who pray with us, encourage us, and remind us of truth.

Others have waited and seen God act. Their testimonies strengthen our faith. "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses... let us run with perseverance" (Hebrews 12:1). Today we lean into community during our waiting seasons.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored waiting''s reality, biblical examples, what it produces, active engagement, emotions, unexpected answers, and community support. Today we commit to trusting God''s timing.

"The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him; it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD" (Lamentations 3:25-26). Waiting isn''t just tolerable; it''s good.

As you complete this study, what are you waiting for? How will you wait actively, honestly, and with community? Trust His timing. He is never early, never late, and always good.'
WHERE slug = 'waiting-gods-timing';

-- PEACE BEYOND UNDERSTANDING
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined maintaining peace. Today we explore peace in relationships—pursuing harmony with others.

"If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18). Peace with God should overflow into peace with others. But notice the qualifiers: "if possible" and "as far as it depends on you." Some people won''t be reconciled.

We do our part: forgive, seek reconciliation, refuse to retaliate, pray for enemies. We can''t control others'' responses, but we can control ours. Today we examine relational peace: Who might God want you to pursue?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed relational peace. Today we explore peace in decision-making—how God''s peace guides.

"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts" (Colossians 3:15). The word "rule" means "umpire"—peace acts as referee, calling decisions safe or out.

When facing decisions, pray and note where peace rests. Lingering unease may signal caution; settled peace may confirm direction. This isn''t the only guidance factor, but it''s significant. "The mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace" (Romans 8:6). Today we practice listening for peace''s guidance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored peace in decisions. Today we address peace amidst chaos—the peace that makes no sense.

The peace Jesus gives "transcends all understanding" (Philippians 4:7). It doesn''t depend on circumstances making sense. Stephen, being stoned, saw heaven open (Acts 7:56). Paul and Silas sang in prison (Acts 16:25). Peace doesn''t require understanding—it requires trusting the One who understands.

When circumstances are chaotic, peace becomes most remarkable. It witnesses to watching others that something supernatural is at work. Today we welcome peace that defies logic.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored peace amidst chaos. Today we examine peace-stealers: what robs our peace and how to respond.

Common peace-stealers include: worry about the future, regret about the past, comparison with others, unforgiveness, unconfessed sin, and unbelief. Each has a remedy: prayer for worry, forgiveness for regret, contentment for comparison, releasing debts for unforgiveness, confession for sin, and trust for unbelief.

Identifying what steals your peace is half the battle. Once identified, apply the appropriate remedy. Today we name our peace-stealers and address them.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 identified peace-stealers. Today we explore becoming peacemakers—extending the peace we''ve received.

"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9). Receiving peace makes us peace-givers. We become instruments of God''s peace in a fractured world.

Peacemaking includes: reconciling estranged parties, calming anxious hearts, speaking truth that settles confusion, and modeling peace that draws questions. "The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever" (Isaiah 32:17). Today we commit to spreading peace.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored peace''s source, access, maintenance, relationships, decision-making, chaos, stealers, and giving. Today we rest in the Prince of Peace.

"For to us a child is born... And he will be called... Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6). Jesus doesn''t just give peace; He is peace. Our peace is a Person.

As you complete this study, how will you cultivate peace? What practices will sustain it? Who needs the peace you''ve received? Live in the peace that transcends understanding, and let it guard your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.'
WHERE slug = 'peace-beyond-understanding';

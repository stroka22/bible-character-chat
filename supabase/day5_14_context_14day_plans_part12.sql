SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored being sent. Today we examine proximity—going to where people are.

Jesus "went through all the towns and villages" (Matthew 9:35). He didn''t wait for people to come; He went. Mission requires proximity.

Where do you have proximity to people who need the gospel? Work, neighborhood, gym, school? Today we see existing relationships as mission fields.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored proximity. Today we examine preparation—being ready to share.

"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have" (1 Peter 3:15). Preparation means knowing your story and the gospel.

Can you explain the gospel simply? Can you share your testimony briefly? Today we prepare.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored preparation. Today we examine prayer for the lost—spiritual work precedes visible results.

"The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field" (Matthew 9:37-38). Jesus said pray; then He sent.

Prayer opens hearts, creates opportunities, and empowers witness. Today we pray for the lost.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored prayer. Today we examine proclamation—at some point, the gospel must be spoken.

"How can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" (Romans 10:14). Living well isn''t enough—words matter.

This doesn''t require pulpits, just conversations. Today we overcome silence.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored proclamation. Today we examine presence—being with people over time.

Jesus didn''t just preach; He ate with sinners, attended their parties, spent time in their spaces. Presence builds trust.

Mission isn''t drive-by evangelism but relational investment. Today we commit to presence.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored presence. Today we examine demonstration—good works that open doors.

"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Visible good creates curiosity.

Service, justice, compassion—all can be gospel demonstrations. Today we demonstrate kingdom reality.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored demonstration. Today we address fear—it''s the primary barrier.

"Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you" (Acts 18:9-10). God told Paul: don''t let fear silence you.

What do you fear? Rejection? Inadequacy? Awkwardness? Today we address fear with faith.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed fear. Today we examine disciple-making—not just converts but disciples.

"Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them... and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20). The goal is disciples, not decisions.

Disciples require investment over time. Today we commit to disciple-making.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored disciple-making. Today we examine multiplication—disciples who make disciples.

"The things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Four generations in one verse.

Mission multiplies through reproduction. Today we think beyond addition to multiplication.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored mission: the commission, God''s heart, sending, proximity, preparation, prayer, proclamation, presence, demonstration, fear, disciple-making, and multiplication.

"You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8).

As you complete this study, how will you live on mission? The Spirit empowers. The harvest waits. Go.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored moral will. Today we examine wisdom principles—making good choices.

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10). Where Scripture doesn''t command, wisdom guides. Not "What does God want?" but "What is wise?"

Wisdom considers: consequences, counsel, character development. Today we apply wisdom to decisions.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored wisdom. Today we examine peace as guide—internal confirmation.

"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts" (Colossians 3:15). "Rule" means "umpire"—peace arbitrates decisions.

When considering options, where do you have peace? Peace doesn''t guarantee ease but often indicates alignment. Today we attend to peace.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored peace. Today we examine open doors—circumstances as guidance.

"I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut" (Revelation 3:8). Sometimes God guides through opportunity or closed doors.

Open doors invite; closed doors redirect. Today we read circumstances wisely.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored circumstances. Today we examine counsel—others'' wisdom.

"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" (Proverbs 15:22). Wise counselors see what we might miss.

Seek counsel from mature believers who know you and know Scripture. Today we pursue wise counsel.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored counsel. Today we examine desires—God shapes them.

"Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart" (Psalm 37:4). As we delight in God, He shapes desires.

What do you want? If you''re walking with God, desires may be guidance. Today we examine desires.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored desires. Today we address paralysis—fear of making wrong choices.

Some people are paralyzed by fear of missing God''s will. But God doesn''t play hide-and-seek with guidance.

"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault" (James 1:5). He wants you to know more than you want to know. Today we overcome paralysis.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed paralysis. Today we examine making decisions—at some point, decide.

After prayer, counsel, and consideration, decide. "Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans" (Proverbs 16:3).

Indecision is itself a decision. Step forward; trust God to direct. Today we learn to decide.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored deciding. Today we address changing course—what if you chose wrong?

God can redirect. "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps" (Proverbs 16:9). Wrong turns become right when God redirects.

You can''t out-choose God''s sovereignty. Today we release fear of wrong choices.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed wrong choices. Today we explore daily will—God''s will for today.

"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own" (Matthew 6:34). What is God''s will for today?

Obey today. Trust tomorrow to God. Today we focus on today''s will.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored God''s will: sovereign, moral, individual (or not), wisdom, peace, circumstances, counsel, desires, paralysis, deciding, course correction, and daily focus.

"Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5-6).

As you complete this study, how will you approach decisions differently? Trust God. Walk forward.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the rapture debate. Today we examine the tribulation—a time of unprecedented distress.

"Then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again" (Matthew 24:21). Jesus described future tribulation.

Revelation describes seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments. Christians interpret these differently (literal/symbolic, future/historical). Today we examine tribulation texts.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored tribulation. Today we examine the antichrist—the man of lawlessness.

"The man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).

Scripture describes an ultimate opponent of Christ who deceives many. Today we examine antichrist passages.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored the antichrist. Today we examine Israel''s role—what about the Jewish people?

"All Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26). Paul describes partial hardening on Israel until full Gentile inclusion, then Israel''s salvation.

Christians disagree about details, but Israel has a place in God''s plan. Today we examine Israel''s future.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Israel. Today we examine the second coming—Christ''s visible, physical return.

"This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). He left visibly; He''ll return visibly.

"Every eye will see him" (Revelation 1:7). Today we anticipate Christ''s return.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Christ''s return. Today we examine the millennium—Christ''s thousand-year reign.

"They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years" (Revelation 20:4). Christians disagree: Is this a literal future period (premillennialism), present spiritual reality (amillennialism), or golden age before Christ''s return (postmillennialism)?

Today we survey millennium views.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored millennium views. Today we examine final judgment—every person will give account.

"We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body" (2 Corinthians 5:10).

"The dead were judged according to what they had done" (Revelation 20:12). Today we face judgment reality.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored judgment. Today we examine hell—the destiny of those apart from Christ.

"They will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life" (Matthew 25:46). Jesus spoke of hell more than anyone.

Hell is sobering reality that motivates mission. Today we take hell seriously.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored hell. Today we examine heaven and new creation—the destiny of the redeemed.

"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth... God''s dwelling place is now among the people" (Revelation 21:1-3). God will make all things new.

Heaven isn''t escape from earth but earth renewed—resurrection bodies in renewed creation. Today we anticipate our future home.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored new creation. Today we examine living with eternity in view—how should this shape us?

"Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God" (2 Peter 3:11-12).

Eternity should shape present living. Today we live with the end in view.',
day14_context = 'We''ve surveyed end times: Christ''s return promise, Daniel and Revelation, rapture, tribulation, antichrist, Israel, second coming, millennium, judgment, hell, heaven, and living with eternity in view.

"He who testifies to these things says, ''Yes, I am coming soon.'' Amen. Come, Lord Jesus" (Revelation 22:20).

As you complete this study, are you ready? Live ready. He could come today.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Jesus'' teaching. Today we see miracles accelerate—power over nature, demons, disease, death.

Jesus calmed a storm: "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!" (Mark 4:41). He expelled Legion into pigs. He healed a woman who touched His garment. He raised Jairus'' daughter.

Mark clusters these mighty works to answer: Who is Jesus? Today we see His authority displayed.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 witnessed miracles. Today we see rejection in Nazareth—familiarity breeds contempt.

"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town" (Mark 6:4). Those who knew Him longest believed Him least. "He could not do any miracles there" (6:5)—not couldn''t but wouldn''t, due to unbelief.

Jesus sent the Twelve with His authority. Today we see mission extending beyond His physical presence.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed rejection and mission. Today we see the feeding of the five thousand—abundance from scarcity.

Five loaves, two fish, five thousand men plus women and children—twelve baskets left over. "They all ate and were satisfied" (Mark 6:42).

Mark is setting up understanding: Jesus provides, but disciples are slow to grasp. Today we see abundant provision.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed feeding. Today Jesus walks on water and disciples'' hearts remain hard.

"They were completely amazed, for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened" (Mark 6:51-52). Despite miracles, they don''t understand.

This theme intensifies: Jesus reveals; disciples struggle. Today we examine our own slow understanding.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 exposed hard hearts. Today Peter confesses Jesus as Christ—the Gospel''s turning point.

"Who do you say I am?" Peter answered: "You are the Messiah" (Mark 8:29). The pivotal confession.

Immediately Jesus predicted His death and rebuked Peter for opposing it. The Christ must suffer. Today we reach Mark''s theological center.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 witnessed Peter''s confession. Today Jesus is transfigured—glory revealed to inner circle.

"His clothes became dazzling white" (Mark 9:3). Moses and Elijah appeared. God spoke: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!" (9:7).

Coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed silence until resurrection. Today we glimpse glory before suffering.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 witnessed transfiguration. Today Jesus heads toward Jerusalem—passion predictions intensify.

Three times Jesus predicted His death (8:31, 9:31, 10:33-34). Three times disciples missed the point. The journey to Jerusalem is journey to the cross.

"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45). Today we see the cross approaching.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 saw passion predictions. Today Jesus enters Jerusalem—the week begins.

Triumphal entry on a donkey (fulfilling Zechariah 9:9), temple clearing, debates with opponents—Mark compresses the final week''s tension.

"The chief priests and the teachers of the law... began looking for a way to kill him" (Mark 11:18). Today we enter passion week.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 entered passion week. Today we witness the last supper, Gethsemane, arrest, and trial.

"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many" (Mark 14:24). Then agony in Gethsemane, betrayal, denial, mockery of a trial.

Mark''s pace quickens as Jesus moves toward the cross. Today we walk through the longest night.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Mark: fast-paced narrative of Jesus'' ministry, miracles, teaching, Peter''s confession, transfiguration, passion predictions, and Jerusalem.

Today Jesus is crucified, dies, and is buried. But Mark doesn''t end there: "He has risen! He is not here" (Mark 16:6).

"The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah" (Mark 1:1). It''s just the beginning. As you complete Mark, will you follow this Jesus?'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 addressed the incest case. Today Paul addresses lawsuits between believers—take it outside?

"Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?" (1 Corinthians 6:7). Better to suffer loss than damage witness through public litigation.

The church should be capable of settling disputes. Today we examine conflict resolution within the body.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed lawsuits. Today Paul addresses sexuality and the body—it belongs to God.

"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit?... You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).

Sexual sin uniquely sins against one''s own body. Today we receive the call to bodily holiness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed bodily holiness. Today Paul addresses marriage, singleness, and divorce (chapter 7).

Both marriage and singleness have value. Neither is spiritually superior. Paul personally valued singleness for undivided devotion but didn''t impose it.

On divorce: God''s ideal is permanence, but Paul addresses complex situations. Today we navigate marriage and singleness.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed marriage. Today Paul addresses food offered to idols—knowledge vs. love.

"Knowledge puffs up while love builds up" (1 Corinthians 8:1). Some knew idols were nothing; they could eat freely. But their freedom might cause weaker believers to stumble.

Love limits liberty for others'' sake. Today we balance freedom and love.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed food and liberty. Today Paul uses himself as example—rights surrendered for gospel.

"I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some" (1 Corinthians 9:22). Paul had rights he didn''t use.

Self-discipline serves mission. Today we examine what rights we might surrender for gospel advance.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Paul''s example. Today we address worship disorder—head coverings and communion abuses.

Corinthian worship was chaotic. Paul addresses propriety in head coverings (culturally specific?) and serious abuse of the Lord''s Supper—some gorged while others went hungry.

"When you come together, it is not the Lord''s Supper you eat" (1 Corinthians 11:20). Today we examine worship order.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed worship order. Today Paul addresses spiritual gifts—unity in diversity (chapters 12-14).

"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them" (1 Corinthians 12:4). The body metaphor shows each part''s necessity.

The Corinthians overvalued tongues; Paul valued prophecy more highly for building up the church. Today we value all gifts rightly.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored gifts. Today we pause at chapter 13—the love chapter amid gift discussion.

"If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong" (1 Corinthians 13:1). Gifts without love are nothing.

Love is patient, kind, not envious or boastful... Love never fails. Today we let love evaluate our gift exercise.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored love. Today Paul addresses resurrection—the heart of the gospel (chapter 15).

"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17). Resurrection is essential, not optional.

Paul argues for bodily resurrection of Christ and future resurrection of believers. Today we ground faith in resurrection.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through 1 Corinthians: divisions, wisdom, immorality, lawsuits, sexuality, marriage, food, worship, gifts, love, and resurrection.

"Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain" (1 Corinthians 15:58).

As you complete this letter, what corrections apply? What encouragements strengthen you? Stand firm.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Jesus as faithful high priest. Today we see Jesus compared to Moses—greater than the greatest prophet.

"Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself" (Hebrews 3:3). Moses was faithful in God''s house; Jesus built the house.

Moses was servant; Jesus is Son. Today we see Jesus'' superiority to Israel''s greatest leader.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 compared Jesus to Moses. Today we encounter the first major warning: don''t miss the rest.

"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion" (Hebrews 3:15). Israel missed Canaan rest through unbelief. Don''t repeat their failure.

"There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God" (4:9). Today we pursue entering God''s rest.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 warned about missing rest. Today we see Jesus as high priest according to Melchizedek—a better priesthood.

Levitical priests were temporary, imperfect, and tribal. Jesus is "a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek" (Hebrews 5:6)—eternal, perfect, and universal.

"Because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood" (7:24). Today we see Jesus'' superior priesthood.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Melchizedek priesthood. Today we encounter another warning: don''t fall away.

"It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened... if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance" (Hebrews 6:4-6). The most debated passage in Hebrews.

This warning applies to those who tasted and turned away, not to struggling believers who persevere. Today we take warning seriously.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 heard the warning. Today we see Jesus inaugurating a better covenant—the new covenant promised by Jeremiah.

"The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant" (Hebrews 8:8, quoting Jeremiah 31:31). Better promises, internal transformation, complete forgiveness.

"By calling this covenant ''new,'' he has made the first one obsolete" (8:13). Today we receive new covenant blessings.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored the new covenant. Today we see Jesus entering a better tabernacle—heaven itself.

The earthly tabernacle was copy and shadow. Jesus "entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God''s presence" (Hebrews 9:24).

His sacrifice was once for all, not repeated annually. Today we see the true tabernacle.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored the heavenly tabernacle. Today we see Jesus offering a better sacrifice—Himself.

"The blood of goats and bulls... are external regulations applying until the time of the new order" (Hebrews 9:10). Animal blood never truly removed sin.

"How much more... will the blood of Christ... cleanse our consciences" (9:14). Today we receive cleansing through His blood.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored Christ''s sacrifice. Today we explore the faith chapter—hall of fame of believing.

"Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see" (Hebrews 11:1). Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Moses, Rahab—all commended for faith.

"These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised" (11:39). Today we join the faith community.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored faith heroes. Today we see the Christian life as race—run with endurance.

"Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus" (Hebrews 12:1-2). Surrounded by witnesses, shedding hindrances, focused on Jesus.

God''s discipline is evidence of sonship, not rejection. Today we run the race.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Hebrews: Jesus superior to angels, Moses, Aaron; warnings against apostasy; better covenant, tabernacle, sacrifice; faith heroes; and running the race.

"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8).

As you complete this study, is Jesus supreme in your life? Are you holding fast? Keep running—the finish is worth it.'

-- WHY JESUS HAD TO DIE
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined propitiation—satisfying God''s wrath. Today we explore another dimension: redemption—being bought back from slavery.

"You were bought at a price" (1 Corinthians 6:20). The marketplace image: we were slaves to sin, owned by another. Christ paid the ransom. "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45).

What was the price? "You were redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect" (1 Peter 1:18-19). His life for ours. We belong to Him now because He paid for us. Today we marvel at redemption''s cost.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined redemption. Today we explore reconciliation—enemies becoming friends through Christ''s death.

"While we were God''s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son" (Romans 5:10). Sin made us enemies of God—not just lawbreakers but active rebels. Reconciliation restored the relationship.

Christ is "our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility" (Ephesians 2:14). Both vertical reconciliation (with God) and horizontal reconciliation (with others) flow from the cross. Today we receive the ministry of reconciliation and become its ambassadors.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined reconciliation. Today we explore substitution—Christ dying in our place.

"He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24). "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us" (2 Corinthians 5:21). The sinless One became sin; the guiltless bore guilt; the eternal One died—so that we might live.

Substitutionary atonement is Christianity''s heart. Without it, we bear our own sins and face our own judgment. With it, Christ bore what we deserved, and we receive what He earned. Today we rest in the exchange: His righteousness for our sin.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined substitution. Today we explore the extent: for whom did Christ die?

"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world" (1 John 2:2). Christ''s death is sufficient for all, efficient for those who believe. The offer is universal; the reception is by faith.

This means no one is beyond hope. The worst sinner can be saved. The gospel is for "whoever believes" (John 3:16). Today we celebrate the breadth of Christ''s provision while recognizing that receiving its benefits requires personal faith.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Christ''s death''s extent. Today we explore its results: what did the cross accomplish for believers?

The cross accomplished: forgiveness of sins (Colossians 2:13), justification—declared righteous (Romans 5:1), adoption as children (Galatians 4:5), freedom from sin''s slavery (Romans 6:18), victory over Satan (Colossians 2:15), and guaranteed glorification (Romans 8:30).

These are not future possibilities but present possessions. What Christ accomplished, we receive by faith. Today we inventory our riches in Christ—every spiritual blessing secured at Calvary.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored why Jesus had to die: sacrifice, propitiation, redemption, reconciliation, substitution, and results. Today we respond with gratitude and surrender.

"The love of Christ compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again" (2 Corinthians 5:14-15).

The cross demands response. How can we receive such love and live unchanged? As you complete this study, let the cross compel you to live no longer for yourself but for Him who died for you.'

-- CREATION, FALL, AND PROMISE
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined covering and clothing—God''s provision for shame. Today we trace sin''s spread from Eden through the early chapters of Genesis.

From murder (Cain and Abel) to corruption (before the flood) to pride (Tower of Babel), sin metastasized rapidly. "The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become" (Genesis 6:5). What Adam and Eve began, their descendants accelerated.

Yet grace kept appearing: God protected Cain, saved Noah''s family, and confused languages rather than destroying Babel. Judgment was always tempered with mercy. Today we see the pattern: sin spreads, but grace pursues.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 traced sin''s spread. Today we witness a crucial turning point: God''s call of Abram—the beginning of redemption''s plan.

"The LORD had said to Abram, ''Go from your country... to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you... and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you''" (Genesis 12:1-3).

From one man, God would build a nation. Through that nation, blessing would reach all nations. The promise to Abraham is the gospel in seed form—Galatians 3:8 calls it "the gospel in advance." Today we see redemption''s plan beginning to unfold.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed Abram''s call. Today we examine the covenant God made with him—unconditional promises that anchor all future redemption.

In Genesis 15, God formalized His promise in a covenant ceremony. Abram cut animals in half; normally both parties would walk between the pieces, taking the curse on themselves if they broke covenant. But only God (as a smoking fire pot and blazing torch) passed through.

This was unconditional promise: God obligated Himself without requiring Abram''s performance. The covenant would stand regardless of human faithfulness—because it depended on God''s faithfulness alone. Today we rest in covenant grace.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined the Abrahamic covenant. Today we trace the promise through Isaac and Jacob—the patriarchs who carried it forward.

God promised Abraham a son through Sarah, despite their advanced age. Isaac was born miraculously. Isaac''s son Jacob (later Israel) became father of twelve sons—the tribes of Israel. Through them, Abraham''s descendants would become a nation.

The promise traveled through chosen individuals: "Not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring" (Romans 9:7). God selected Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. Today we see God sovereignly guiding His redemptive plan through generations.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 traced the promise through Isaac and Jacob. Today we meet Joseph—the one who preserved the promise-bearers in Egypt.

Joseph''s story is a miniature gospel: betrayed by brothers, sold for silver, falsely accused, seemingly forgotten, then exalted to save those who betrayed him. "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (Genesis 50:20).

Joseph preserved Israel in Egypt, setting up the Exodus—the defining redemption event until the cross. Today we see God working even through betrayal and suffering to accomplish His purposes.',
day10_context = 'We''ve journeyed from creation through fall to promise—and traced that promise through Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Today we look forward to fulfillment.

Everything in Genesis points ahead: the serpent-crusher (3:15), Abraham''s blessing to all nations (12:3), and the scepter from Judah (49:10). The Old Testament is a story looking for an ending—a problem awaiting a solution.

That solution is Jesus: the woman''s seed who crushed Satan, Abraham''s offspring through whom nations are blessed, the Lion of Judah who reigns forever. As you complete this study, see how the story you''ve traced finds its fulfillment in Christ.'

-- TRINITY EXPLAINED
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored what the Trinity means practically. Today we examine the Trinity in the Old Testament—hints of plurality within unity.

"In the beginning God [Elohim—plural form] created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). "Let us make mankind in our image" (Genesis 1:26). "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4)—yet the word "one" (echad) can mean unified plurality (as in Genesis 2:24).

The Old Testament also distinguishes between the LORD and His Angel, His Spirit, and His Wisdom (Proverbs 8). These hints prepared for the New Testament''s full revelation of three Persons in one God. Today we trace these early indicators.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined Old Testament hints. Today we explore the Trinity in the New Testament—full revelation of three Persons.

At Jesus'' baptism: "Heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ''This is my Son''" (Matthew 3:16-17). Father speaking, Son being baptized, Spirit descending—three distinct Persons acting simultaneously.

The Great Commission: "baptizing them in the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19). One name, three Persons. Today we see the New Testament''s explicit Trinitarian revelation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined New Testament revelation. Today we explore each Person''s distinct role in salvation.

The Father plans salvation: "He chose us in him before the creation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4). The Son accomplishes salvation: "We have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (Hebrews 10:10). The Spirit applies salvation: "He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit" (Titus 3:5).

All three work together in our salvation. To lose any Person is to lose salvation''s completeness. Today we appreciate each Person''s contribution.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined salvation roles. Today we explore Trinitarian prayer: how do we address the three-in-one God?

We pray to the Father: "Our Father in heaven" (Matthew 6:9). We pray through the Son: "I will do whatever you ask in my name" (John 14:13). We pray by the Spirit: "The Spirit helps us in our weakness... intercedes for us" (Romans 8:26).

All three are involved in prayer. We approach the Father, through the Son, empowered by the Spirit. Trinitarian prayer isn''t a formula but relationship with the full Godhead. Today we practice praying with Trinitarian awareness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Trinitarian prayer. Today we address common errors: what the Trinity is NOT.

Modalism says God is one Person who appears in three modes—like an actor playing three roles. But Father, Son, and Spirit interact simultaneously (Jesus'' baptism proves this wrong).

Tritheism says there are three gods. But "the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4).

Arianism says the Son and Spirit are created beings, less than the Father. But "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1).

Today we avoid these errors while humbly acknowledging mystery beyond full comprehension.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored the Trinity''s meaning, Old Testament hints, New Testament revelation, salvation roles, prayer implications, and common errors. Today we worship the Triune God.

"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Corinthians 13:14). Paul''s benediction captures Trinitarian blessing.

The Trinity isn''t abstract doctrine but living relationship. We know the Father''s love, experience the Son''s grace, and enjoy the Spirit''s fellowship. As you complete this study, let knowledge lead to worship of the God who is forever one and forever three.'

-- WHAT IS SALVATION
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined salvation''s solution: grace through faith. Today we explore justification more deeply—how God declares sinners righteous.

"God... justifies the ungodly" (Romans 4:5). This is stunning: God doesn''t justify the righteous but the ungodly! Justification isn''t God recognizing our goodness but declaring us righteous based on Christ''s righteousness credited to us.

Justification is forensic—a legal declaration. "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1). The verdict is in; the case is closed. Today we rest in the reality that our standing before God is settled—not by our performance but by Christ''s.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored justification. Today we examine sanctification—the process of becoming what we''ve been declared.

Justification is instantaneous; sanctification is progressive. "He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion" (Philippians 1:6). We''re being transformed into Christ''s image "with ever-increasing glory" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

Sanctification involves our effort: "Work out your salvation" (Philippians 2:12). But it depends on God''s power: "for it is God who works in you" (2:13). We work because He works. Today we embrace the ongoing process of becoming holy.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined sanctification. Today we look forward: glorification—salvation''s completion when Christ returns.

"We know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:2). Glorification completes what justification declared and sanctification developed. We will be fully conformed to Christ''s image.

"The creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God" (Romans 8:21). Not just our bodies but all creation will be renewed. Today we anticipate salvation''s glorious conclusion.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 anticipated glorification. Today we examine assurance: how can we know we''re saved?

"I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life" (1 John 5:13). Assurance is possible—and important.

Assurance rests on: God''s promises (what He said), the Spirit''s witness (internal confirmation), and changed lives (evidence of new birth). Doubts may come, but we return to these foundations. Today we strengthen our assurance on biblical grounds.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined assurance. Today we explore salvation''s security: can we lose it?

Jesus said: "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand" (John 10:28). Strong words! Yet warnings exist about falling away.

How do we reconcile these? Those truly saved will persevere—not perfectly but ultimately. Apparent "loss" of salvation reveals it was never genuinely possessed: "They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us" (1 John 2:19). Today we find security in God''s keeping power while taking warnings seriously.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored salvation''s need (sin), solution (grace), declaration (justification), process (sanctification), completion (glorification), assurance, and security. Today we respond with worship.

Salvation is all of God—from start to finish. "From him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever!" (Romans 11:36). We contribute nothing but our need; He provides everything.

As you complete this study, marvel at salvation''s scope. You were dead; now alive. Condemned; now acquitted. Enslaved; now free. Lost; now found. Let gratitude overflow in worship and service to the God who saved you.'
WHERE slug = 'what-is-salvation';

-- SIN, REPENTANCE, AND REDEMPTION
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined repentance. Today we explore confession—the specific acknowledgment that leads to cleansing.

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). Confession means agreeing with God about our sin—calling it what He calls it, without excuse or minimization.

Confession is specific, not vague: "I sinned by lying about X" rather than "I''m not perfect." It takes responsibility: "I did this" rather than "mistakes were made." And it trusts God''s promise: He is faithful to forgive. Today we practice honest confession.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined confession. Today we explore redemption—God''s act of buying us back from slavery.

"You were bought at a price" (1 Corinthians 6:20). Redemption is marketplace language: a slave is purchased and set free. We were "slaves to sin" (Romans 6:17); Christ paid our ransom; now we''re "slaves to righteousness" (6:18).

The price was staggering: "not with perishable things such as silver or gold... but with the precious blood of Christ" (1 Peter 1:18-19). We belong to Him because He paid for us. Today we reflect on redemption''s cost and respond with grateful surrender.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined redemption. Today we explore its results: freedom from sin''s power, not just penalty.

"For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace" (Romans 6:14). Before redemption, we couldn''t not sin. After redemption, we can choose righteousness. The compulsive power is broken.

This doesn''t mean we''re sinless but that we''re no longer helpless. We can resist, repent, and grow. "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Galatians 5:16). Today we embrace freedom''s reality and responsibility.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored freedom from sin''s power. Today we address ongoing sin: what happens when redeemed people still sin?

Christians still sin—not as lifestyle but as lapses. "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves" (1 John 1:8). What then?

"If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One" (1 John 2:1). Christ intercedes for us. We confess, receive forgiveness, and continue growing. Ongoing sin doesn''t cancel redemption but should decrease over time as the Spirit transforms us. Today we find grace for the ongoing journey.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed ongoing sin. Today we explore restitution: making right what we''ve wronged.

Zacchaeus, after encountering Jesus, declared: "If I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount" (Luke 19:8). Genuine repentance often involves practical restoration where possible.

Restitution isn''t earning forgiveness (that''s already given) but demonstrating sincerity. It may include: returning stolen goods, paying debts, seeking reconciliation with those wronged, or making public what was publicly damaged. Today we consider whether any restitution is needed.',
day10_context = 'We''ve journeyed through sin''s nature, repentance''s reality, confession''s practice, redemption''s cost, freedom''s gift, ongoing grace, and restitution''s role. Today we commit to living as redeemed people.

"You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Redemption changes ownership—we belong to Christ now.

As you complete this study, how will you live differently? What sins need ongoing battle? What freedoms need embracing? What restorations need making? Live as who you are: redeemed, forgiven, and free.'

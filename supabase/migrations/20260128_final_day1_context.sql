-- Gospel in the Old Testament
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Many Christians treat the Old Testament as mere background—interesting history but not really about Jesus. Yet Jesus Himself said, "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me" (John 5:39). The gospel wasn''t invented in the New Testament; it was revealed progressively from Genesis onward.

The first gospel announcement came in Eden. God told the serpent that the woman''s offspring would crush his head (Genesis 3:15)—the "protoevangelium" or first gospel. From there, the scarlet thread of redemption weaves through every book: Abel''s accepted sacrifice, Noah''s ark of salvation, Abraham''s promised seed, the Passover lamb, the bronze serpent, the suffering servant of Isaiah, and countless other shadows pointing to the Light.

This study traces gospel themes through the Old Testament: sacrifice, substitution, covenant, promise, and hope. You''ll see how Israel''s entire history prepared for Christ and how the Old Testament authors, though they didn''t fully understand, wrote about the salvation that would come through Jesus (1 Peter 1:10-12).'

-- Lord's Prayer 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'When the disciples asked Jesus to teach them to pray, He gave them what we call the Lord''s Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4). This model prayer has been recited billions of times across two millennia—yet its familiarity can breed thoughtlessness. Prayed with understanding, it transforms how we approach God.

The prayer''s structure is significant. It begins with worship ("hallowed be your name"), moves to kingdom priorities ("your kingdom come, your will be done"), then addresses personal needs (daily bread, forgiveness, deliverance from evil). This order corrects our tendency to rush to requests before aligning our hearts with God''s purposes.

Each phrase is rich with meaning. "Our Father" establishes relationship and community. "In heaven" reminds us of His transcendence. "Give us this day" teaches daily dependence. "Forgive us as we forgive" links vertical and horizontal relationships. "Lead us not into temptation" acknowledges our weakness. This seven-day study unpacks each phrase, transforming rote recitation into meaningful conversation with your Father.'

-- Resurrection Power
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The resurrection of Jesus Christ is Christianity''s cornerstone. Paul wrote, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17). But Christ has been raised—and His resurrection changes everything for those who believe.

The resurrection wasn''t resuscitation (coming back to the same mortal life) but transformation (entering a new order of existence). Jesus'' resurrection body was physical—He ate fish, could be touched—yet also gloriously different: appearing through locked doors, unrecognized at first, ascending to heaven. This is the prototype of what awaits all believers.

But resurrection power isn''t only future. Paul prayed to know "the power of his resurrection" (Philippians 3:10) as a present reality. The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in believers now (Ephesians 1:19-20). This study explores resurrection: its historical reality, its theological meaning, its future promise, and its present power available to you today.'
WHERE slug = 'resurrection-power';

-- Sermon on the Mount (full version)
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) is Jesus'' most famous teaching—and His most challenging. Delivered on a hillside near Capernaum early in His ministry, it describes life in God''s kingdom. Its standards are impossibly high, which is precisely the point.

The sermon opens with the Beatitudes—blessings pronounced on the poor in spirit, the mourning, the meek, and others the world overlooks. Then Jesus addresses the Law, not abolishing it but intensifying it: not just murder but anger, not just adultery but lust, not just oaths but complete integrity. He commands enemy-love, secret giving, persistent prayer, and freedom from anxiety.

The sermon drives us to grace. We cannot achieve this righteousness through willpower—we need the very Savior who speaks these words. Once justified by faith, the Spirit begins transforming us into people who increasingly embody these kingdom values. The sermon is both our goal and our gradual growth, describing the character that grace produces over a lifetime of following Jesus.'
WHERE slug = 'sermon-on-mount';

-- Teachings of Jesus
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Jesus was called "Rabbi" (Teacher) more than any other title during His ministry. Crowds marveled: "No one ever spoke the way this man does" (John 7:46). His teaching combined authority ("You have heard it said... but I tell you"), accessibility (parables from everyday life), and urgency (the kingdom was at hand).

Jesus taught about God—a Father who knows our needs, seeks the lost, and welcomes prodigals home. He taught about the kingdom—already present yet still coming, entered through new birth, characterized by radical values. He taught about discipleship—counting the cost, denying self, taking up crosses. He taught about relationships—forgiveness without limit, love for enemies, servant leadership.

This study surveys Jesus'' major teachings thematically rather than verse-by-verse through one Gospel. We''ll cover the Sermon on the Mount, the parables, the "I AM" statements, the Upper Room Discourse, and other key instruction. The goal is comprehensive exposure to what Jesus actually taught—letting His words shape our thinking and living.'

-- Why Jesus Had to Die
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The cross stands at Christianity''s center. Every Gospel devotes significant space to Jesus'' final week; the Lord''s Supper memorializes His death; the earliest Christian confession was "Christ died for our sins" (1 Corinthians 15:3). But why? Why did the Son of God have to die?

The short answer is sin. God is holy and just—He cannot simply overlook evil. Sin creates a debt that must be paid, a penalty that must be served. Yet God is also loving and merciful—He desires relationship with His creatures. The cross resolves this tension: God''s justice is satisfied (sin is punished) while His mercy is displayed (we are pardoned). Jesus, the sinless one, bore our sin so we could receive His righteousness.

This study explores the cross from multiple angles: Old Testament sacrificial background, the events of Passion Week, biblical explanations of atonement (propitiation, redemption, reconciliation, victory), and personal application. The goal is not just understanding why Jesus died but experiencing fresh gratitude for the love that sent Him there.'

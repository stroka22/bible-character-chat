-- 7 Day Faith Reset
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve explored God, humanity, and Christ''s rescue. Today we examine the life-changing response: faith and repentance.

"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins" (Acts 2:38). This was Peter''s call at Pentecost—the response to hearing about Jesus.

Repentance means turning—a complete change of direction. You were living for self; now you live for God. You were heading away from Him; now you head toward Him. It''s not merely feeling sorry but actually changing course.

Faith means trusting—not just believing facts about Jesus but banking your eternal destiny on Him. Faith says, "Jesus, I''m putting my whole weight on You. My righteousness isn''t enough; Yours is."

These aren''t separate steps but two sides of one coin. You can''t turn to Christ without turning from sin. You can''t trust the Savior without distrusting your own efforts.

Have you turned and trusted? This isn''t a one-time event you''ve completed but an ongoing posture. Daily we turn from sin and trust Christ afresh. The initial turn establishes the direction; daily turns maintain it.

"If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Today we embrace newness—turning from the old and trusting in Christ.'

-- Galatians 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve established justification by faith and Paul''s astonishment at the Galatians'' desertion. Today we explore the relationship between law and promise.

Paul argues that the law didn''t cancel the earlier promise to Abraham. "The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise" (Galatians 3:17).

So what was the law''s purpose? "It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come" (3:19). The law revealed sin, restrained sin, and pointed toward the coming Seed (Christ).

"Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not!" (3:21). Law and promise have different functions, not opposing purposes. "For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law."

But the law can''t give life—it can only reveal our need for life. "Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe" (3:22).

"So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith" (3:24). The law was temporary, preparatory—a tutor leading us to Christ. Now that Christ has come, we''re no longer under the tutor.

Today we thank God for the law that revealed our need and the gospel that meets it.'

-- Ephesians 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve explored our blessings, our former condition, and our new position. Today Paul reveals the mystery: Jew and Gentile united in one body.

"This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 3:6).

This was revolutionary. Jews and Gentiles were separated by the deepest cultural, religious, and social barriers. The temple itself had a wall separating the Court of the Gentiles from inner courts, with inscriptions warning Gentiles of death if they proceeded.

But in Christ, "he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility" (2:14). Jesus didn''t just improve relations—He created one new humanity from two hostile groups.

"For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit" (2:18). Equal access. No Jew/Gentile distinction in approaching God.

"Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God''s people and also members of his household" (2:19). Full citizenship. Full belonging.

This mystery—Gentiles fully included—shapes the church. We''re not a Jewish sect but a new humanity drawn from every nation, united in Christ.

Today we celebrate the unity Christ creates across every human barrier.'

-- Philippians 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve explored the Christ hymn and working out our salvation. Today Paul shares his own perspective: counting everything loss for Christ.

"But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord" (Philippians 3:7-8).

Paul had impressive credentials: circumcised the eighth day, tribe of Benjamin, Pharisee, zealous, faultless regarding the law (3:5-6). By Jewish standards, he was accomplished.

But he came to see it differently: "I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith" (3:8-9).

His own righteousness, impressive as it was, was "garbage" compared to Christ''s righteousness received through faith. Self-achievement versus gift.

"I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death" (3:10). Paul''s goal wasn''t just knowing about Christ but knowing Him—intimately, experientially, through both power and suffering.

Today we evaluate what we''re trusting. Our achievements and credentials—or Christ? What might we need to count as "garbage"?'

-- Colossians 5 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve celebrated Christ''s supremacy and explored living from our heavenly position. Today Paul provides practical instructions for relationships.

"Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them" (Colossians 3:18-19). Within marriage, distinct roles serve each other. Wives'' submission is "fitting in the Lord"—not cultural convention but kingdom order. Husbands'' love excludes harshness—Christlike self-giving, not domination.

"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged" (3:20-21). Children obey; fathers don''t provoke. Authority comes with responsibility to use it wisely.

"Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord" (3:22). Paul doesn''t endorse slavery but instructs those in it. Work heartily, as for the Lord, not just when watched. This transforms any work situation.

"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving" (3:23-24).

Today we bring Christ into every relationship and every task—knowing our ultimate Master sees all.'

-- James 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve examined trials, the tongue, and the need for doing, not just hearing. Today James addresses faith and works—a passage often misunderstood.

"What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?" (James 2:14). The question isn''t whether faith saves (it does) but whether faith-without-deeds is genuine faith.

James gives an illustration: "Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, ''Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,'' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?" (2:15-16). Words without action are worthless. So is claimed faith without corresponding life.

"You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder" (2:19). Demons have accurate theology; they''re not saved. Mere intellectual assent isn''t saving faith.

"Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?" (2:21). Abraham''s faith was demonstrated by action. "His faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did" (2:22).

James doesn''t contradict Paul. Paul addressed justification before God (by faith). James addresses demonstration before people (by works). Genuine faith produces works; works prove faith genuine.

Today we examine: does our faith show in our actions?'

-- 1 Peter 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve explored living hope, refined faith, and new identity. Today Peter addresses submission to authority—even unjust authority.

"Submit yourselves for the Lord''s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors" (1 Peter 2:13-14). Peter wrote under Nero''s reign—hardly a just ruler. Yet submission was commanded.

Why submit to imperfect authorities? "For it is God''s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people" (2:15). Good citizenship silences criticism of Christians. Bad citizenship confirms suspicions.

"Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God''s slaves" (2:16). Freedom in Christ doesn''t mean freedom from earthly structures. We''re free—and we voluntarily submit for God''s sake.

"Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh" (2:18). Even unjust treatment doesn''t justify rebellion. Why?

"To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps" (2:21). Christ submitted to injustice—for our salvation. We follow His example.

This is countercultural. We want to fight injustice with resistance. Peter says to overcome evil with good, trusting God to vindicate.

Today we submit to authorities—not because they''re perfect but because God is sovereign.'
WHERE slug = '1-peter-7-days';

-- 1 John 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve examined light, love, and tests of faith. Today John addresses confidence in prayer—how we can know God hears us.

"This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him" (1 John 5:14-15).

The key phrase: "according to his will." This isn''t a loophole but a focusing lens. Prayer aligned with God''s will has guaranteed results. How do we know God''s will? Scripture reveals it. The Spirit guides.

"Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him" (3:21-22). Clean conscience and obedient life create conditions for confident prayer.

What is God''s will? That we believe in Jesus (3:23). That we love one another (3:23). That we be sanctified (1 Thessalonians 4:3). These prayers we can pray with certainty.

Prayer isn''t manipulation but alignment. We don''t change God''s mind; we discover and embrace His will. Prayer works not because we have power but because He does.

"We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true" (5:20). Today we pray confidently—aligned with the will of a God who hears and answers.'

-- Abraham Journey
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve seen Abraham''s call, departure, and first failure in Egypt. Today we witness the Abrahamic covenant formalized—God''s dramatic commitment.

God told Abram to bring specific animals, cut them in half (except birds), and arrange the pieces. This was how ancient Near Eastern covenants were made—both parties would walk between the pieces, signifying "may this be done to me if I break this covenant."

"As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him" (Genesis 15:12). God spoke of Israel''s future: slavery in Egypt, deliverance, and eventual possession of the land.

Then something remarkable: "When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces" (15:17). God alone passed through. Abram didn''t walk.

The significance is profound: God took both obligations upon Himself. If this covenant failed, God would pay the price. This was unconditional commitment—not "if you obey, I will bless" but "I will bless, period."

"On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram" (15:18). God bound Himself to promises regardless of Abraham''s performance.

At the cross, God paid the covenant price. Jesus bore the curse that should have fallen on covenant-breakers (us). The blazing torch that passed through the pieces led to Calvary.

Today we rest in a covenant that depends on God''s faithfulness, not ours.'

-- David: A Man After God''s Heart
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve seen David''s anointing, Goliath victory, and wilderness years. Today we witness his greatest sin—and its devastating consequences.

David was king. His army was at war, but "David remained in Jerusalem" (2 Samuel 11:1). Wrong place, wrong time. From his roof, he saw Bathsheba bathing. He sent for her. He slept with her. She became pregnant.

Rather than confess, David covered up. He summoned her husband Uriah from the battlefield, hoping he''d sleep with his wife and think the child was his. Uriah''s integrity thwarted the plan—he wouldn''t enjoy comforts while his comrades fought.

So David arranged Uriah''s death. A message to Joab: put Uriah in the fiercest battle and withdraw. Uriah died. David married Bathsheba.

"But the thing David had done displeased the LORD" (11:27). Nathan the prophet confronted David with a parable about a rich man stealing a poor man''s lamb. David raged at the injustice. Nathan said, "You are the man!" (12:7).

David''s response? "I have sinned against the LORD" (12:13). No excuses, no blaming. Psalm 51 records his anguished repentance: "Create in me a pure heart, O God."

God forgave—but consequences followed. The child died. Sword and strife plagued David''s house. Sin forgiven doesn''t mean consequences erased.

Today we learn that even "a man after God''s heart" can fall terribly. And we learn that genuine repentance finds genuine forgiveness.'

-- Joseph Story
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve witnessed Joseph''s betrayal, sale into slavery, and unjust imprisonment. Today we see providence unfold—dreams in prison that lead to destiny.

In prison, Joseph encountered Pharaoh''s cupbearer and baker. Both had troubling dreams. "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams" (Genesis 40:8). Joseph deflected credit to God even while displaying remarkable gifting.

He interpreted both dreams. The cupbearer would be restored; the baker would be executed. Both came true. Joseph asked the cupbearer to remember him to Pharaoh—but "the chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him" (40:23).

Two more years passed. Forgotten. Then Pharaoh had dreams that troubled him—no one could interpret. The cupbearer finally remembered: "I remember my faults today" (41:9). He told Pharaoh about Joseph.

Joseph was summoned, cleaned up, and brought before Pharaoh. Once again, he deflected: "I cannot do it, but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires" (41:16).

He interpreted the dreams: seven years of plenty, seven years of famine. He proposed a plan. Pharaoh recognized "the spirit of God" in Joseph (41:38) and made him second-in-command over all Egypt.

From pit to prison to palace. Thirteen years of suffering followed by sudden exaltation. God''s timing is precise, even when it feels unbearably long.

Today we trust that God''s "forgetting" is actually timing—positioning us for purposes we can''t yet see.'

-- Moses Leadership
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'We''ve witnessed Moses'' call and Pharaoh''s resistance. Today we see the plagues culminate and deliverance come—the exodus itself.

Nine plagues had devastated Egypt, yet Pharaoh remained defiant. The tenth and final plague would break him: death of every firstborn.

But God provided protection. The Passover lamb''s blood on doorframes caused the destroyer to "pass over" Israelite homes. "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" (Exodus 12:13).

At midnight, "the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt" (12:29). Pharaoh summoned Moses: "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested" (12:31). After centuries of slavery, Israel walked free.

"The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children" (12:37). Perhaps two million people, plus livestock, plus possessions—the Egyptians gave them silver, gold, and clothing.

"During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron... Leave my people!" (12:31). What began at a burning bush in the wilderness concluded with a midnight march to freedom. What seemed impossible—Pharaoh releasing his slave labor force—happened exactly as God said.

"This day shall be for you a memorial day... You shall keep it as a feast to the LORD" (12:14). The exodus became Israel''s defining story—remembered annually through Passover.

Today we remember our exodus: delivered from sin''s bondage through the true Passover Lamb, Jesus Christ.'

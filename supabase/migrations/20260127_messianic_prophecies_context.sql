-- Day 1: Born of a Virgin
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Around 700 years before Jesus was born, the prophet Isaiah delivered a remarkable message to King Ahaz of Judah. The kingdom was under threat, and God offered Ahaz a sign—any sign he wanted. When Ahaz refused (falsely claiming piety), Isaiah declared that God would give a sign anyway: "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel."

The Hebrew word used here is "almah," which means a young woman of marriageable age. While some argue this could simply mean "young woman," the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), made 200 years before Christ, translated it as "parthenos"—which unambiguously means "virgin."

Matthew, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, sees this prophecy fulfilled in Mary''s miraculous conception. The angel tells Joseph not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife because "what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."

Why does the virgin birth matter? It establishes that Jesus is both fully human (born of a woman) and fully divine (conceived by the Holy Spirit). He didn''t inherit a sin nature from a human father, making Him the perfect, sinless sacrifice. The name "Immanuel" means "God with us"—and in Jesus, God literally came to dwell among humanity.

This is just the first of over 300 Old Testament prophecies that Jesus fulfilled—prophecies written centuries before His birth, copied and preserved by Jewish scribes who had no interest in supporting Christian claims.'

-- Day 2: Born in Bethlehem
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'The prophet Micah, writing around 700 BC, pinpointed the exact town where the Messiah would be born: Bethlehem Ephrathah. This wasn''t Jerusalem, the capital and religious center. It wasn''t a major city at all. Bethlehem was a small, insignificant village—yet Micah declared that from this tiny place would come "one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."

That last phrase is stunning. The ruler from Bethlehem would have origins "from of old, from ancient times" (literally "from days of eternity"). This isn''t describing a mere human king—it''s describing someone who existed before time began.

How did Jesus end up being born in Bethlehem? His parents lived in Nazareth, about 90 miles away. It took a decree from Caesar Augustus—the most powerful man in the world—ordering a census that required people to return to their ancestral towns. Joseph, being of David''s line, had to go to Bethlehem, David''s city.

Think about the orchestration required: a pagan emperor, knowing nothing of Jewish prophecy, issues an administrative order that moves a pregnant woman to exactly the right location at exactly the right time. Mary and Joseph didn''t choose Bethlehem. Caesar didn''t know about Micah''s prophecy. Yet God''s word, spoken 700 years earlier, was fulfilled precisely.

The religious leaders knew this prophecy well. When the Magi asked Herod where the Messiah would be born, the chief priests and scribes immediately quoted Micah 5:2. They knew where to look—they just didn''t go look.'

-- Day 3: From the Line of David
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'God made a covenant with King David around 1000 BC, promising that his throne would be established forever. The prophet Jeremiah, writing about 400 years later during Judah''s darkest days, reaffirmed this promise: God would raise up a "righteous Branch" from David''s line who would reign wisely and be called "The LORD Our Righteousness."

By the time Jesus was born, the Davidic monarchy had been defunct for nearly 600 years. The Jews were under Roman occupation. No descendant of David sat on any throne. The royal line seemed to have reached a dead end.

Yet both Matthew and Luke carefully document Jesus'' genealogy, tracing His lineage back to David. Matthew traces Joseph''s line (Jesus'' legal ancestry), while Luke likely traces Mary''s line (His biological ancestry through His mother). Both converge on David.

This matters because God''s promises are specific. The Messiah couldn''t come from just any Jewish family—He had to come from David''s house. The genealogies, which modern readers often skip, were essential proof to first-century Jews that Jesus had the right credentials.

Jeremiah''s title for the Messiah—"The LORD Our Righteousness"—is remarkable. In Hebrew, it''s "Yahweh Tsidkenu." Jeremiah is saying the coming King won''t just be righteous; He will BE Yahweh (God''s personal name) who becomes our righteousness. This is exactly what Paul later explains: Christ "has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption" (1 Corinthians 1:30).

The Branch from David''s stump didn''t just restore an earthly kingdom—He established an eternal one.'

-- Day 4: Called Out of Egypt
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'This prophecy demonstrates one of the most fascinating aspects of biblical interpretation: how events in Israel''s history foreshadow (or "typify") events in Jesus'' life.

Hosea 11:1 originally referred to the Exodus—God calling the nation of Israel, His "son," out of Egypt. Yet Matthew, inspired by the Holy Spirit, sees a deeper fulfillment when Joseph takes Mary and the infant Jesus to Egypt to escape Herod''s massacre, and later returns after Herod''s death.

How can a historical statement about Israel also be a prophecy about Jesus? Because Jesus is the true Israel—He embodies and fulfills everything Israel was meant to be. Where Israel failed, Jesus succeeded. Israel was God''s son who was often unfaithful; Jesus is God''s Son who was perfectly faithful.

This pattern repeats throughout Scripture: Israel spent 40 years in the wilderness being tested; Jesus spent 40 days in the wilderness being tested. Israel crossed through the Red Sea; Jesus was baptized in the Jordan. Israel received the Law at Sinai; Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount.

Jesus relives Israel''s story and gets it right. He is the faithful Son, the true Vine, the genuine Israel. What seemed like a desperate flight to Egypt to escape a murderous king was actually the fulfillment of prophetic pattern—God''s Son being called out of Egypt to bring salvation not just to one nation, but to all nations.

The early church father Irenaeus called this "recapitulation"—Jesus recapitulating (summarizing and completing) all of human and Israelite history in Himself.'

-- Day 5: Preceded by a Messenger
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Both Malachi (the last Old Testament prophet, around 430 BC) and Isaiah (about 700 BC) predicted that a messenger would prepare the way for the Lord''s coming. Isaiah describes "a voice calling in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the LORD."

For 400 years after Malachi, no prophetic voice was heard in Israel. This "silent period" made the appearance of John the Baptist all the more dramatic. Suddenly, a wild man emerges from the wilderness wearing camel''s hair and eating locusts, proclaiming that the kingdom of heaven is near.

John himself explicitly identified his role using Isaiah''s words: "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ''Make straight the way for the Lord.''" He understood his mission wasn''t to draw attention to himself but to prepare people for someone greater.

Malachi''s prophecy is even more striking: "I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple." Notice: the messenger prepares the way before "me"—God speaking. Then "the Lord" comes to His temple. The messenger prepares the way for God Himself to arrive.

John prepared the way for Jesus. If the prophecy is accurate, that means Jesus is the Lord—Yahweh in human flesh—coming to His temple. This is exactly what happened when Jesus cleansed the temple, declaring it "my Father''s house."

Jesus confirmed John''s identity: "This is the one about whom it is written: ''I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.''" The last Old Testament prophecy found its fulfillment in the first New Testament prophet.'

-- Day 6: Ministry in Galilee
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Isaiah prophesied that the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali—the region of Galilee—would be honored after initially being humbled. This area, in northern Israel, was the first to fall to Assyrian conquest in 732 BC. It was considered a backwater, a place of mixed populations and questionable religious purity. "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" was a common sentiment.

Yet Isaiah declared that this despised region would see "a great light." The people walking in darkness would experience dawn.

Jesus grew up in Nazareth of Galilee. He launched His public ministry not in Jerusalem (the religious center) or Judea (the "pure" Jewish heartland) but in Galilee. He called His first disciples—fishermen from Galilee. He performed His first miracle in Cana of Galilee. He delivered many of His most famous teachings around the Sea of Galilee.

Matthew explicitly connects this to Isaiah''s prophecy: by ministering in Galilee, Jesus was fulfilling the promise that light would dawn on those in darkness.

There''s a profound theological point here. God doesn''t start with the elite, the powerful, or the religiously respectable. He begins in obscure Bethlehem, grows up in despised Nazareth, and ministers in "Galilee of the Gentiles." The last become first. The humble are exalted. The places everyone overlooks become the stage for God''s greatest work.

The religious leaders in Jerusalem largely rejected Jesus. But in Galilee—among fishermen, tax collectors, and ordinary people—the light shone and was received.'

-- Day 7: Healing and Miracles
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Isaiah 35 paints a beautiful picture of what the Messianic age would look like: "Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy."

When John the Baptist, sitting in Herod''s prison, sent messengers to ask Jesus if He was truly "the one who is to come," Jesus didn''t give a theological lecture. He pointed to the evidence: "Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor."

Jesus was essentially saying, "Look at Isaiah 35. It''s happening. Draw your own conclusion."

The miracles weren''t random displays of power. They were prophetic signs—credentials proving Jesus was the promised Messiah. Each healing was a preview of the complete restoration God will bring when Christ returns. Every blind eye opened pointed to a coming day when all blindness—physical and spiritual—will be healed. Every lame person who walked anticipated a new creation where nothing will be broken.

The religious leaders demanded signs, but they ignored the signs right in front of them. People who had been blind from birth were seeing. People who hadn''t walked in decades were leaping. The dead were being raised. Isaiah''s prophecy was being fulfilled in their streets, and they missed it because Jesus didn''t fit their expectations.

The question John asked from prison is the same question everyone must answer: Is Jesus the One, or should we expect another? His miracles provide the answer.'

-- Day 8: Speaking in Parables
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Psalm 78 opens with a declaration that the psalmist will speak in parables and "utter hidden things, things from of old." Matthew sees this pattern fulfilled in Jesus'' teaching ministry, where parables became His primary method of public instruction.

A parable is a story drawn from everyday life that reveals spiritual truth. Jesus told stories about farmers and seeds, lost sheep and coins, fathers and sons, kings and servants. The images were familiar; the meanings were profound.

But why speak in parables? Wouldn''t straightforward teaching be clearer? Jesus explained to His disciples that parables served a dual purpose: to reveal truth to those with receptive hearts and to conceal it from those who had already rejected Him. "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them."

This seems harsh until you understand the context. The religious leaders had already decided to destroy Jesus. They attributed His miracles to Satan. They had hardened their hearts against the truth. Speaking plainly to them would only increase their condemnation. The parables gave them what they wanted—an excuse to dismiss Him—while preserving deeper truth for those genuinely seeking.

Jesus'' parables fulfilled another prophecy from Isaiah 6: the people would be "ever hearing but never understanding; ever seeing but never perceiving." Spiritual blindness isn''t just about not having information—it''s about refusing to receive truth that''s clearly presented.

The same parables that confounded the proud enlightened the humble. The message was the same; the hearts were different.'

-- Day 9: Entering Jerusalem on a Donkey
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Zechariah, prophesying around 520 BC, described the Messiah''s entrance into Jerusalem in vivid detail: "See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."

This was not how kings typically arrived. Conquering kings rode war horses. They came with armies and chariots. But Zechariah''s king comes "lowly" (or "humble"), riding a donkey—an animal of peace.

Jesus orchestrated His entrance to fulfill this prophecy precisely. He sent disciples to find a donkey and its colt, telling them exactly where to look and what to say. The owners let the animals go, just as Jesus predicted. He rode into Jerusalem while crowds spread their cloaks and palm branches on the road, shouting "Hosanna to the Son of David!"

The "Triumphal Entry" happened on what we call Palm Sunday, exactly as Zechariah foretold. But the triumph was ironic. Within a week, the same crowds would cry "Crucify Him!" The king came to His capital, and His capital rejected Him.

Yet even in this, prophecy was fulfilled. Jesus wept over Jerusalem, saying, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes." The city didn''t recognize the day of its "visitation" (Luke 19:44).

The donkey matters. Jesus came the first time as a humble servant, offering peace. When He returns, Revelation shows Him on a white horse, coming as conquering King. The first time fulfilled Zechariah 9:9—humble and riding a donkey. The second time will fulfill the rest of the prophecy—bringing justice to the nations.'

-- Day 10: Betrayed by a Friend
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Psalm 41, written by David about 1000 BC, contains a haunting line: "Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me." David experienced betrayal by his advisor Ahithophel, who joined Absalom''s rebellion. But the psalm finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus and Judas.

Jesus quoted this exact verse at the Last Supper, applying it to His coming betrayal. "I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: ''He who shared my bread has turned against me.''"

The intimacy of the betrayal makes it worse. Judas wasn''t a distant enemy. He was one of the Twelve, hand-picked by Jesus, entrusted with the group''s money, present for three years of miracles and teaching. He reclined at the same table, dipped bread in the same dish.

John''s Gospel provides haunting details. Jesus dipped bread and gave it to Judas, a gesture of honor and friendship. Then "Satan entered into him." Jesus said, "What you are about to do, do quickly." Judas went out, and John adds the chilling observation: "And it was night."

Why did Judas betray Jesus? The Gospels don''t fully explain. Greed played a role—he stole from the money bag. Disillusionment perhaps—Jesus wasn''t the political Messiah Judas wanted. Whatever the human motivations, the betrayal was prophesied a millennium earlier.

Even in this darkest moment, Jesus remained in control. He knew who would betray Him, when it would happen, and how it would unfold. The betrayal didn''t catch God off guard—it fulfilled His word.'

-- Day 11: Sold for Thirty Pieces of Silver
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Zechariah 11 contains one of the most specific and remarkable prophecies about the Messiah''s betrayal. The prophet, acting out a symbolic drama, asks for his wages after serving as a shepherd. He''s paid thirty pieces of silver—the price of a slave (Exodus 21:32). God tells him to "throw it to the potter"—this "handsome price at which they valued me."

The sarcasm is biting. Thirty silver coins was an insultingly low amount—the compensation owed if your ox gored someone''s slave. That''s how much they valued God''s shepherd.

Five hundred years later, Judas approached the chief priests asking, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?" They counted out thirty pieces of silver—exactly the amount Zechariah prophesied.

The fulfillment continues. When Judas saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse. He threw the silver pieces into the temple and went and hanged himself. The priests, deciding the money was tainted, used it to buy the potter''s field as a burial place for foreigners.

Matthew explicitly notes this fulfilled "what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet" (attributing it to Jeremiah because that prophetic book came first in the Hebrew ordering, though the quote is from Zechariah). Every detail matches: thirty pieces of silver, thrown in the temple, used to buy a potter''s field.

No human could have arranged these details. Judas didn''t know about Zechariah 11. The priests weren''t trying to fulfill prophecy. Yet their freely-made decisions—the exact price, throwing the money into the temple, buying a potter''s field—matched a 500-year-old prophecy precisely.'

-- Day 12: Silent Before Accusers
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Isaiah 53, often called the "Suffering Servant" passage, describes someone who "was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth."

This is remarkable because silence before accusers was not the norm. Jewish and Roman legal proceedings expected the accused to defend themselves. Remaining silent was seen as accepting guilt. Any innocent person would naturally protest, explain, argue.

Yet Jesus, standing before the Sanhedrin, Pilate, and Herod, remained largely silent. "When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, ''Don''t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?'' But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor."

Pilate was amazed because this never happened. Prisoners begged, argued, made excuses. Jesus stood silent.

Why? Because He was not a victim being railroaded—He was a sacrifice being offered. Lambs don''t argue with the priest. They are led silently to the altar. Jesus understood His mission: "No one takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord."

His silence also fulfilled another dimension of Isaiah''s prophecy. The Servant was "assigned a grave with the wicked" though "he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth." Jesus didn''t protest His innocence because He was willingly taking the place of the guilty. He wasn''t silent from weakness but from determined purpose.'

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Isaiah 50:6 describes the Servant''s suffering in visceral terms: "I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting."

In the ancient Near East, pulling someone''s beard and spitting in their face were extreme insults—signs of utter contempt and rejection. Combined with beating, this describes systematic humiliation designed to break a person''s spirit.

The Gospel accounts record exactly these abuses. During Jesus'' trial before the Sanhedrin, "they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him." Before Pilate, the Roman soldiers "stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head... They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again."

The mockery was calculated cruelty. They dressed Him in royal purple, gave Him a reed as a scepter, and bowed in mock worship: "Hail, king of the Jews!" They were ridiculing His claim to kingship, not knowing they were actually worshiping the true King of the universe.

Notice Isaiah''s wording: "I offered my back... I did not hide my face." This isn''t passive victimization—it''s voluntary submission. The Servant willingly endured the abuse. Jesus could have called twelve legions of angels. He could have struck His tormentors blind or dead. Instead, He "offered" Himself to their brutality.

Peter later wrote: "When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly" (1 Peter 2:23).'

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Isaiah 53:12 prophesied that the Servant would be "numbered with the transgressors." Though completely innocent, He would be counted as a criminal, executed alongside criminals.

Luke records: "Two other men, both criminals, were led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left."

Jesus, the only truly innocent person who ever lived, died between two guilty men. He wasn''t given a special execution befitting His innocence—He was treated as just another criminal, His cross indistinguishable from the others except for Pilate''s sign.

But the story doesn''t end with the humiliation. One of those criminals, watching Jesus die, had a change of heart. While the other criminal hurled insults, this man rebuked him: "Don''t you fear God, since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."

Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." And Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."

In His death, Jesus did exactly what He came to do—save sinners. The very criminals He was "numbered with" became the recipients of His grace. One rejected Him; one received Him. The cross between criminals became a place of judgment and salvation.

This is the gospel in miniature: the innocent One takes His place among the guilty, and those who trust Him receive paradise.'

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Psalm 22, written by David around 1000 BC, contains a line that has puzzled Jewish interpreters for centuries: "They pierce my hands and my feet." David never experienced this. No form of execution in ancient Israel involved piercing hands and feet.

Yet 1,000 years after David wrote these words, the Romans perfected a method of execution that did exactly this: crucifixion. Iron spikes were driven through the victim''s wrists and feet, pinning them to a wooden cross.

The Jews didn''t practice crucifixion. It was a Roman innovation, considered so shameful that Roman citizens were exempt from it. David couldn''t have known about crucifixion through natural means—it didn''t exist in his world.

After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples. Thomas, who had missed the first appearance, declared he wouldn''t believe unless he could see and touch the nail marks in Jesus'' hands and the wound in His side. A week later, Jesus appeared again and invited Thomas: "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."

Thomas''s response? "My Lord and my God!" The pierced hands became proof of identity and grounds for worship.

The wounds remained even in Jesus'' glorified resurrection body. When He returns, Revelation says, people will "look on the one they have pierced" (quoting Zechariah 12:10). Throughout eternity, the Lamb will bear the marks of His sacrifice. The pierced hands that David prophesied a millennium before crucifixion existed will be visible forever.'

-- Day 16: Mocked and Scorned
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Psalm 22 contains perhaps the most detailed prophecy of crucifixion in the Old Testament, written 1,000 years before the event. The psalmist describes being surrounded by enemies who mock him with specific words: "He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him."

Matthew records that while Jesus hung on the cross, "Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads... In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. ''He saved others,'' they said, ''but he can''t save himself!... He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him.''"

The mockers at the cross didn''t know they were quoting Psalm 22. They thought they were making up their own insults. But their spontaneous words of derision matched David''s prophecy verbatim.

There''s deep irony here. They mocked Jesus for trusting God, not knowing He was doing exactly that—trusting the Father''s plan of salvation. They taunted that He "saved others but can''t save himself," not understanding that He could save Himself but chose not to, because saving Himself would mean not saving others.

Psalm 22 begins with the words Jesus cried from the cross: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Any Jewish hearer would recognize this as the opening line of the psalm. By quoting it, Jesus was pointing them to the entire psalm—including its triumphant ending, where God does answer, and "future generations will be told about the Lord."

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Psalm 69, another psalm of David, describes intense suffering that finds ultimate fulfillment in Christ: "They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst."

Gall was a bitter, poisonous substance. Vinegar (or sour wine) was the cheap drink of common people and soldiers. Both represent cruelty to someone in desperate need—offering bitterness instead of comfort.

The Gospels record two different drinks offered to Jesus at the cross. First, before crucifixion, they offered Him "wine mixed with gall" (Matthew 27:34) or "wine mixed with myrrh" (Mark 15:23). This was actually a mild mercy—a narcotic mixture intended to dull the pain. Jesus tasted it but refused to drink. He would face the full weight of suffering with unclouded mind.

Later, near the end, Jesus said "I am thirsty." A sponge was soaked in sour wine and lifted to His lips. After receiving it, Jesus declared "It is finished" and died.

The physical thirst pointed to a deeper reality. Jesus, who offered living water to the woman at the well, experienced terrible thirst on the cross. The One who said "whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst" was Himself dying of thirst.

John notes that Jesus said "I am thirsty" specifically "so that Scripture would be fulfilled." Even in His agony, Jesus was aware of prophetic fulfillment. He wasn''t merely a victim of circumstances—He was consciously completing what had been written about Him.

The bitter drink fulfilled Psalm 69. The vinegar fulfilled it. Everything had been foretold.'

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Psalm 34:20 declares of the righteous sufferer: "He protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken." This finds its fulfillment in an unusual detail of Jesus'' crucifixion.

Crucifixion was designed to kill slowly through exhaustion, dehydration, and eventually asphyxiation. Victims could linger for days. To hasten death—especially before the Sabbath—executioners would break the victim''s legs (called "crurifragium"). Unable to push up to breathe, death would come quickly.

John records: "Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down."

The soldiers broke the legs of the two criminals crucified with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus, He was already dead. So "they did not break his legs." Instead, to confirm death, a soldier pierced His side with a spear, bringing "a sudden flow of blood and water."

John emphasizes: "The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: ''Not one of his bones will be broken.''"

This connects to another prophetic thread: the Passover lamb. Exodus 12:46 required that no bone of the Passover lamb be broken. Jesus is "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). His bones remained intact, just like the Passover lambs of old.

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Zechariah 12:10 contains a stunning prophecy: "They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child."

Notice who is speaking: God says "they will look on ME, the one they have pierced." God is describing Himself being pierced. How can the eternal, spiritual God be pierced?

The answer is the incarnation. God the Son took on human flesh and was pierced on a Roman cross. John, standing at the foot of the cross, witnessed the fulfillment: "One of the soldiers pierced Jesus'' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water... these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled... ''They will look on the one they have pierced.''"

John changed "me" to "the one"—not contradicting Zechariah but clarifying that Jesus, the one pierced, is the Lord of Zechariah''s prophecy.

The blood and water have theological significance. Some see them representing the two sacraments: communion (blood) and baptism (water). Others see them proving real death—the separation of blood cells and serum that occurs after death. Still others see them representing the two key elements of salvation: blood for forgiveness, water for cleansing.

Zechariah continues: mourning will follow the piercing. On the Day of Pentecost, when Peter preached that Israel had crucified their Messiah, "they were cut to the heart" and 3,000 repented and were baptized. The mourning had begun.

The full mourning awaits Christ''s return, when "every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him" (Revelation 1:7).'

UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'Isaiah 53:9 contains a seemingly contradictory prophecy: "He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth."

How can someone be buried with both the wicked AND the rich? Crucified criminals were typically thrown into common graves or left for scavengers. Jesus was "assigned" (destined for) such a grave—He was executed as a criminal between criminals.

But something unexpected happened. Joseph of Arimathea, described by Matthew as "a rich man" and by Mark as "a prominent member of the Council," boldly asked Pilate for Jesus'' body. He took the body, wrapped it in clean linen, and "placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock."

Jesus died among the wicked (the two criminals) but was buried among the rich (in Joseph''s expensive tomb). Both parts of Isaiah''s prophecy were fulfilled.

Joseph''s actions were costly. As a member of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish ruling council), publicly honoring Jesus would end his political career and invite persecution. Handling a dead body made him ceremonially unclean for Passover. The expensive tomb, meant for himself, was given to a convicted criminal.

Yet Isaiah already knew. Seven centuries before Joseph was born, the prophet recorded that a rich man would provide the Messiah''s grave.

The new tomb was also significant. No body had ever been placed in it. When Jesus rose, no one could claim the wrong body had emerged or that His bones had been confused with another''s. The tomb''s newness testified to the uniqueness of His resurrection.'

-- Day 21: Risen from the Dead
UPDATE public.reading_plan_days 
SET context = 'All the prophecies we''ve studied would mean nothing if Jesus had stayed dead. A dead Messiah is a failed Messiah. But Psalm 16, written by David 1,000 years before Christ, contains a remarkable statement: "You will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay."

David died and was buried. His tomb was known and visited in Peter''s day. David''s body did see decay. So what did David mean?

Peter, preaching on the Day of Pentecost, explains: "Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay."

David was prophesying about his greater descendant—the Messiah whose body would not decay because He would rise from the dead.

Paul makes the same point in Acts 13: "When David had served God''s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed. But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay."

The resurrection is the vindication of everything Jesus claimed. It proves He is who He said He was. It confirms that His sacrifice was accepted. It guarantees that everyone who trusts in Him will also rise.

Over 300 prophecies fulfilled. A virgin birth, a Bethlehem birthplace, a ministry in Galilee, betrayal for thirty silver coins, silence before accusers, pierced hands and feet, bones unbroken, burial in a rich man''s tomb, and resurrection from the dead.

The mathematical probability of one person fulfilling just eight of these prophecies by chance has been calculated at 1 in 10^17 (one hundred quadrillion). Jesus fulfilled over 300.

The evidence is overwhelming: Jesus is the promised Messiah, the Son of God, the Savior of the world.'

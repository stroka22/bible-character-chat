-- ============================================

-- Biblical Leadership 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Biblical leadership differs radically from worldly models. Jesus told His disciples, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them... Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant" (Matthew 20:25-26). This servant-leadership model inverts the world''s power pyramid.

The Bible provides numerous leadership examples—some positive (Moses, David, Nehemiah), some negative (Saul, Rehoboam, Ahab). Their stories reveal principles: leaders need character before competence, humility before authority, and clear calling before public platform. Leadership without character leads to disaster.

This study examines biblical leadership principles: casting vision, building teams, developing others, handling criticism, making decisions, maintaining integrity, and finishing well. Whether you lead a family, a team, a church, or an organization, these timeless principles apply. The goal isn''t position or power but influence exercised for God''s glory and others'' good.'
WHERE slug = 'biblical-leadership-14';

-- Biblical Love and Marriage
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'In a culture confused about love and marriage, Scripture provides clarity. God invented both. Marriage was His idea before sin entered the world—not a social construction but a creation ordinance reflecting Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:31-32).

Biblical love isn''t primarily feeling but commitment—choosing another''s good regardless of emotional fluctuations. The Greek New Testament uses several words for love: agape (selfless, sacrificial), phileo (friendship), and storge (family affection). Marriage should involve all of these, anchored in agape that perseveres when feelings fade.

This study explores God''s design for love and marriage: the husband''s sacrificial headship modeling Christ, the wife''s respectful submission modeling the church, communication that builds up, conflict resolution that honors God, sexual intimacy as covenant renewal, and building a legacy. Whether single, engaged, or married, these truths provide foundation for relationships that glorify God.'
WHERE slug = 'biblical-love-marriage';

-- Conflict Resolution Biblical
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Conflict is inevitable. Sinful people living in close proximity will disagree, offend, and hurt each other. The question isn''t whether conflict will occur but how we''ll handle it. Scripture provides clear guidance that most Christians ignore.

Jesus outlined a simple process: go privately first, then with witnesses, then to the church (Matthew 18:15-17). Paul commanded, "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18). James diagnosed conflict''s root: desires that battle within us (James 4:1). Most conflict escalates because we handle it unbiblically—gossiping instead of confronting, attacking instead of listening.

This study applies biblical principles to real conflicts: family tensions, church disagreements, workplace disputes, and friendship ruptures. We''ll learn to address issues quickly, speak truth in love, listen to understand, pursue reconciliation over victory, and when necessary, accept unresolved differences. Peacemaking is hard work but blessed work—Jesus called peacemakers "children of God" (Matthew 5:9).'
WHERE slug = 'conflict-resolution-biblical';

-- Faith at Work
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Most Christians spend the majority of their waking hours at work—yet many see it as secular, separate from their "real" spiritual life on Sundays. Scripture presents a different view: all work can be worship, every workplace a mission field, every task done for the Lord.

Colossians 3:23-24 commands: "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." This transforms the most mundane job into sacred service.

This study explores faith-work integration: how to view your job as calling, maintain integrity under pressure, witness through excellence and relationships, handle difficult bosses and coworkers, balance ambition with contentment, and see eternal significance in temporal tasks. The goal is eliminating the sacred-secular divide, recognizing that in every legitimate occupation we can glorify God and serve His purposes.'
WHERE slug = 'faith-at-work';

-- Friendship God''s Way
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Loneliness is an epidemic. Despite social media''s promise of connection, meaningful friendships are increasingly rare. Yet Scripture highly values friendship: "Two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). Jesus called His disciples "friends" (John 15:15).

Biblical friendship is covenant, not convenience. David and Jonathan''s friendship survived jealousy, betrayal by Jonathan''s father, and years of separation. Ruth''s commitment to Naomi—"Where you go I will go"—became a model of loyal love. Proverbs extols the friend who "loves at all times" and "sticks closer than a brother" (17:17; 18:24).

This study explores friendship biblically: how to choose friends wisely, be a faithful friend, handle conflict without abandonment, maintain friendships across distances, and balance family, church, and friendship obligations. In a disconnected age, Christians can model the deep community humans were designed for—beginning with authentic friendship.'
WHERE slug = 'friendship-gods-way';

-- Growing When Spiritually Stuck
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Every believer experiences spiritual plateaus—seasons when growth seems to stall, disciplines feel dry, and faith goes through the motions. These "dark nights of the soul" are normal but shouldn''t become permanent. God hasn''t abandoned us; He may be working in ways we can''t perceive.

The Psalms are full of honest complaints about spiritual dryness: "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God... Why have you forgotten me?" (Psalm 42:1, 9). Yet these laments typically end with chosen trust and anticipated praise.

This study diagnoses common causes of spiritual stagnation—unconfessed sin, physical exhaustion, neglected disciplines, unrealistic expectations—and prescribes remedies. Sometimes the answer is repentance; sometimes it''s rest; sometimes it''s simply persevering through the desert. We''ll learn from biblical figures who experienced and emerged from spiritual dryness, discovering that these seasons often precede seasons of greater fruitfulness.'
WHERE slug = 'growing-when-stuck';

-- Holiness in a Broken World
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = '"Be holy, because I am holy" (1 Peter 1:16, quoting Leviticus). Holiness seems outdated, even offensive, in a culture that celebrates self-expression without moral boundaries. But holiness isn''t uptight religiosity—it''s wholeness, health, being set apart for God''s purposes.

The Hebrew word for holy (qadosh) means "separate, distinct." God is holy—utterly unlike anything else, morally pure, transcendent in perfection. His people are to reflect His character, distinct from the surrounding culture not in weird isolation but in beautiful differentiation.

This study explores holiness practically: sexual purity in a pornographic age, integrity in a dishonest culture, generosity in a consumer society, humility in an image-obsessed world. Holiness isn''t achieved through rules but through relationship—beholding God''s glory and being transformed into the same image (2 Corinthians 3:18). We become holy as we increasingly know the Holy One.'
WHERE slug = 'holiness-broken-world';

-- Humility and Obedience
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Pride was the first sin—Lucifer wanting to ascend above God—and it remains sin''s root. "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble" (James 4:6). Humility isn''t thinking poorly of yourself but thinking of yourself less—and of God and others more.

Jesus modeled perfect humility: "Being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing... he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death" (Philippians 2:6-8). Humility and obedience are inseparable—the humble person accepts God''s authority; the proud person demands his own way.

This study examines biblical humility and its companion, obedience. We''ll see how pride manifests (not just arrogance but also false humility, comparison, and defensiveness) and how genuine humility grows. Obedience flows from humility—recognizing that God''s ways are higher than ours and His commands are for our good. The goal is the freedom that comes from submitting to a trustworthy Lord.'
WHERE slug = 'humility-and-obedience';

-- Integrity in a Compromised World
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Integrity comes from "integer"—whole, undivided. A person of integrity is the same in public and private, at church and at work, online and in person. There''s no gap between profession and practice. In a world of spin, posturing, and image management, integrity stands out.

The Bible connects integrity with God''s character: "The Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he" (Deuteronomy 32:4). Since God cannot lie or deceive, His people should be marked by truthfulness and reliability.

This study examines integrity in various contexts: truth-telling (even when costly), financial honesty, keeping promises, admitting mistakes, and consistency between public image and private character. We''ll see biblical examples—Joseph, Daniel, Nehemiah—who maintained integrity under pressure. The stakes are high: "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out" (Proverbs 10:9).'
WHERE slug = 'integrity-compromised-world';

-- Justice and Mercy
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Justice and mercy seem like opposites—justice gives what''s deserved; mercy withholds deserved punishment. Yet God perfectly embodies both. At the cross, "Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other" (Psalm 85:10). God''s justice was satisfied; His mercy was displayed.

The prophets thundered about justice: "Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!" (Amos 5:24). They condemned exploitation of the poor, corrupt courts, and oppression of the vulnerable. God cares deeply about how the powerful treat the powerless.

This study explores biblical justice and mercy: what they mean, how they relate, and how we practice them. We''ll examine social justice (systemic issues), personal justice (our dealings with others), and the ultimate justice achieved at the cross. The goal is becoming people who "act justly and love mercy and walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8)—reflecting His character in a world that needs both justice and mercy.'
WHERE slug = 'justice-and-mercy';

-- Living Spirit-Led Life
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The Christian life is impossible without the Spirit. Jesus told His disciples they were better off with Him gone because the Spirit would come (John 16:7). Paul commanded, "Be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18)—not a one-time event but a continuous yielding to the Spirit''s control.

Being Spirit-led isn''t about dramatic manifestations but daily dependence. The Spirit guides into truth (John 16:13), convicts of sin (John 16:8), empowers witness (Acts 1:8), produces Christlike character (Galatians 5:22-23), distributes gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11), and intercedes in prayer (Romans 8:26). He''s not an impersonal force but a Person who can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30) and quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).

This study explores Spirit-led living: how to be filled, how to discern the Spirit''s leading, how to avoid grieving or quenching Him, and how spiritual gifts function in the body. The goal is moving from knowing about the Spirit to consciously depending on Him moment by moment.'
WHERE slug = 'living-spirit-led';

-- Major Prophets Explained
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The Major Prophets—Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel—are "major" not because they''re more important but because they''re longer than the Minor Prophets. Together they span from about 740 BC (Isaiah) to 530 BC (Daniel), covering Judah''s decline, exile, and hope of restoration.

Prophets weren''t primarily future-predictors but forth-tellers—speaking God''s word to their contemporary situations. They called for repentance, warned of judgment, confronted injustice, and promised restoration. Their immediate message was for their own time; their ultimate message pointed to Christ.

This study provides an accessible overview of each major prophet: historical context, major themes, key passages, and New Testament connections. Isaiah''s Suffering Servant, Jeremiah''s New Covenant, Ezekiel''s vision of resurrection, Daniel''s kingdom visions—all find fulfillment in Christ. Understanding the prophets enriches appreciation of how all Scripture points to Jesus.'
WHERE slug = 'major-prophets-explained';

-- Minor Prophets Made Simple
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The twelve Minor Prophets (Hosea through Malachi) often gather dust in Bibles—they seem obscure, repetitive, and hard to understand. Yet these small books contain some of Scripture''s most powerful imagery and most relevant messages. Jesus quoted them; early Christians treasured them.

The Minor Prophets span roughly 300 years, from Amos (760 BC) to Malachi (430 BC). They address northern Israel before its fall to Assyria, Judah before and after its Babylonian exile, and the returned community facing disillusionment. Their themes remain timely: social justice, religious hypocrisy, faithful love, and coming judgment.

This study walks through each Minor Prophet with accessible summaries: who wrote it, when, to whom, and why. We''ll discover Jonah''s lesson on God''s mercy to enemies, Micah''s requirement to act justly and love mercy, Habakkuk''s struggle with God''s ways, and Malachi''s call to genuine worship. These neglected books will become beloved treasures.'
WHERE slug = 'minor-prophets-simple';

-- Near to the Brokenhearted
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = '"The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit" (Psalm 34:18). This promise meets us in life''s darkest moments—when loss, betrayal, failure, or tragedy shatters our hearts. God doesn''t stand distant; He draws near.

Brokenheartedness takes many forms: grief over death, divorce, estrangement from children, health crises, shattered dreams, depression, or seasons when everything falls apart at once. The Bible validates this pain—it''s filled with laments, tears, and honest questions. Jesus Himself was "deeply moved in spirit and troubled" at Lazarus''s tomb (John 11:33).

This study guides the brokenhearted through Scripture''s comfort. We''ll read psalms of lament, promises of God''s presence, examples of suffering saints, and the hope of future restoration. The goal isn''t quick fixes or easy answers but the slow, steady comfort that God provides through His Word and His presence. He is near—even when we can''t feel Him.'
WHERE slug = 'near-to-brokenhearted';

-- New Heaven and New Earth
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Christianity''s ultimate hope isn''t escape from earth but earth''s renewal. "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth... And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ''Look! God''s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them''" (Revelation 21:1, 3).

Popular Christianity often pictures heaven as disembodied souls floating on clouds playing harps. But Scripture promises bodily resurrection and a renewed creation—heaven coming to earth. The new creation isn''t plan B (God salvaging what He can from a ruined world) but plan A all along (creation finally achieving its intended glory).

This study explores Scripture''s teaching on the world to come: resurrection bodies, the new Jerusalem, what we''ll do in eternity, and how this hope transforms present living. "If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied" (1 Corinthians 15:19). But our hope extends beyond this life to a renewed creation where God dwells with His people forever.'
WHERE slug = 'new-heaven-new-earth';

-- Obedience Over Comfort
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'God rarely calls us to comfortable obedience. Abraham left his homeland. Moses confronted Pharaoh. Esther risked death. The disciples left their nets. Jesus went to the cross. Obedience often costs something—which is precisely why it demonstrates genuine faith.

Our culture worships comfort. Marketing promises to make life easier, faster, smoother. We avoid discomfort and pursue pleasure. But Jesus said, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me" (Luke 9:23). The cross wasn''t comfortable.

This study examines biblical figures who chose obedience over comfort—and what happened when others chose comfort over obedience. We''ll apply these lessons to contemporary situations: obedience in marriage, parenting, workplace, finances, and witness. The goal isn''t asceticism (suffering for its own sake) but willingness to follow wherever God leads, trusting that "no eye has seen, no ear has heard... what God has prepared for those who love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).'
WHERE slug = 'obedience-over-comfort';

-- Patience, Perseverance, Endurance
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Instant gratification is the norm. We stream entertainment immediately, receive packages next day, and grow frustrated when web pages load slowly. But spiritual growth takes time. Character formation requires the very patience our culture erodes.

The Bible groups patience, perseverance, and endurance together. James writes, "Consider it pure joy... whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete" (James 1:2-4). Trials aren''t obstacles to maturity but pathways to it.

This study explores these interrelated virtues: patience with people, patience with circumstances, perseverance through trials, and endurance to the finish. We''ll see how Jesus "for the joy set before him endured the cross" (Hebrews 12:2), and how we can develop staying power in an age of giving up. The goal is becoming people who "run with perseverance the race marked out for us."'
WHERE slug = 'patience-perseverance-endurance';

-- Paul''s Letters Explained
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Paul''s 13 letters constitute nearly one-quarter of the New Testament. Written between roughly AD 48-67, they address real churches facing real problems—and thereby provide timeless guidance for all churches in all ages. Understanding these letters transforms our grasp of Christian faith and practice.

Paul''s letters follow a general pattern: greeting, thanksgiving, doctrinal teaching, practical application, and closing. Romans, his longest, systematically presents the gospel. The Corinthian correspondence addresses church disorder. Galatians defends justification by faith. Ephesians soars with cosmic vision. Philippians radiates joy from prison. Colossians counters false teaching. The Thessalonian letters address Christ''s return. The Pastoral Epistles (Timothy, Titus) guide church leadership. Philemon appeals for a runaway slave.

This study provides an accessible overview of each letter: when written, to whom, why, and major themes. By understanding each letter''s context, we read it not as random verses but as coherent communication—and apply it more accurately to our situations.'
WHERE slug = 'pauls-letters-explained';

-- Prophets Overview 21 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The prophetic books comprise roughly one-quarter of the Old Testament—yet they''re the least-read portion for most Christians. They seem repetitive, confusing, and irrelevant. But Jesus quoted the prophets constantly, and the New Testament sees them fulfilled in Him.

Old Testament prophets served as God''s covenant enforcement officers. When Israel broke covenant, prophets announced judgment. When Israel repented (or when judgment fell), prophets offered hope. Their message had immediate application and ultimate fulfillment—patterns that recur until Christ brings final redemption and judgment.

This three-week study surveys all the prophets—major and minor—providing historical context, major themes, and Christ connections for each. You''ll gain a mental framework for understanding prophetic literature and appreciation for how all Scripture points to Jesus. The prophets wrote centuries ago, but their message of judgment, hope, and coming King remains urgently relevant.'
WHERE slug = 'prophets-21-days';

-- Ready for Christ''s Return
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Jesus promised to return. "I will come back," He told His disciples (John 14:3). Angels confirmed it at His ascension: "This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go" (Acts 1:11). Every New Testament author assumed Christ''s return was imminent.

Christians disagree on details—timing, sequence of events, millennium. But all agree on the core: Christ will return visibly, bodily, and gloriously to judge the living and dead and to consummate His kingdom. This isn''t escapism but motivation for faithful living now.

This study examines Scripture''s teaching on Christ''s return: why He''s coming, what will happen, and how we should live in light of it. We''ll address common questions and avoid getting lost in speculative charts. The goal is the readiness Jesus commanded: "You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him" (Luke 12:40). Are you ready?'
WHERE slug = 'ready-for-return';

-- Unity in the Body of Christ
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Jesus prayed for His followers'' unity—"that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you... so that the world may believe that you have sent me" (John 17:21). Our unity is evangelistic; our divisions undermine our witness. Yet Christians are notoriously divided.

The early church faced unity challenges: Jewish-Gentile tensions, rich-poor divisions, personality-based factions. Paul addressed these repeatedly: "There is one body and one Spirit... one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:4-6). Unity isn''t uniformity—diversity exists within the body—but it is essential oneness in Christ.

This study explores biblical unity: its basis (our common salvation), its enemies (pride, preference, prejudice), and its cultivation (humility, forbearance, love). We''ll examine how to maintain unity in local churches and how to relate to Christians in other traditions. The goal is being "eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3).'
WHERE slug = 'unity-body-christ';

-- Walking with God Daily
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Enoch "walked with God" (Genesis 5:24). Noah "walked with God" (Genesis 6:9). Abraham was called to "walk before me faithfully" (Genesis 17:1). This walking metaphor pictures ongoing, personal, progressive relationship—step by step, day by day, in conscious fellowship with the Creator.

Daily walking with God doesn''t require monastic withdrawal but practicing His presence in ordinary life. Brother Lawrence learned to commune with God while washing dishes; Frank Laubach experimented with "game with minutes," seeing how many moments each hour he could think of God. Such awareness transforms mundane routine into sacred encounter.

This study explores daily walking with God: morning disciplines that launch the day, moment-by-moment awareness, evening reflection, and the rhythm of work and rest. We''ll address common obstacles—busyness, distraction, guilt over inconsistency—and provide practical help for developing sustainable patterns. The goal is not impressive spiritual performance but genuine friendship with God through ordinary days.'

-- Bearing Fruit that Lasts
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Jesus said, "I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last" (John 15:16). Not just activity but lasting impact; not just busyness but eternal significance. Fruit-bearing is the measure of a life well-lived.

In John 15, Jesus uses a vineyard metaphor: He''s the vine, we''re branches, the Father is the gardener. Branches don''t strain to produce fruit—they receive life from the vine. Fruitfulness flows from abiding, not striving. "Apart from me you can do nothing" (15:5). The gardener prunes fruitful branches to increase their yield, explaining why sometimes God''s most productive servants experience painful cutting.

This study examines fruit-bearing: what it is (character and converts), how it happens (abiding in Christ), what hinders it (sin, self-reliance), and what cultivates it (spiritual disciplines). The goal is shifting from activity-based evaluation ("How much am I doing?") to fruit-based evaluation ("What lasting difference is my life making?").'
WHERE slug = 'bearing-fruit-lasts';

-- Bible and End Times
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'End-times teaching generates more heat than light. Charts, timelines, and confident predictions have often proved embarrassing when the predicted dates passed. Yet eschatology (study of last things) is biblical—roughly one-quarter of Scripture concerns future events. The goal is biblical understanding, not sensationalism.

The Bible teaches certain facts about the end: Christ will return visibly, the dead will be raised, final judgment will occur, God will create a new heaven and new earth. Christians disagree about details: timing of rapture, nature of millennium, identity of antichrist. Humility is appropriate where Scripture isn''t definitive.

This study surveys major biblical end-times passages: Daniel''s visions, Jesus'' Olivet Discourse, Paul''s Thessalonian letters, and Revelation. We''ll explain different interpretive approaches without insisting on one system. The focus is on agreed essentials and their implications for how we live now. Eschatology isn''t just future speculation—it shapes present faithfulness.'
WHERE slug = 'bible-end-times';

-- Bible Overview 60 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The Bible is one book with one story: creation, fall, redemption, restoration. From Genesis to Revelation, it traces God''s plan to rescue humanity and renew creation through His Son. Yet most readers struggle to see how 66 books by 40 authors over 1,500 years form a unified whole.

This two-month overview provides the biblical literacy needed to understand any individual passage in its larger context. We''ll trace the main storyline: creation''s goodness, sin''s devastation, Israel''s calling, prophetic anticipation, Christ''s appearing, church''s mission, and consummation''s hope. Along the way, we''ll locate each biblical book within this grand narrative.

By the end, you''ll have a mental map of Scripture. When you read about David, you''ll know where he fits. When Hebrews mentions Melchizedek, you''ll remember his story. When Revelation echoes Ezekiel, you''ll recognize the connection. This big-picture understanding makes all future Bible study more fruitful.'
WHERE slug = 'bible-overview-60';

-- Epistles 30 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The New Testament epistles (letters) comprise 21 of its 27 books—everything from Romans through Jude. Written to churches and individuals facing real challenges, they apply gospel truths to practical life and thereby provide timeless guidance for believers today.

The epistles divide into Pauline (13 letters) and General (8 letters by various authors). They share common features: greeting, thanksgiving, body (teaching and application), and closing. They assume readers know Old Testament background and apostolic teaching, building on foundations laid elsewhere.

This month-long study surveys every epistle, providing context and key themes for each. We''ll read selections from each letter, enough to grasp its message without overwhelming with too much text. By month''s end, you''ll understand what each epistle addresses and be equipped to study any of them more deeply. The epistles aren''t abstract theology but practical guidance for following Jesus in the real world.'
WHERE slug = 'epistles-30-days';

-- Gospels 30 Days (also checking for existing reference)
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—tell one story from four perspectives. Like four witnesses to an event, they emphasize different details while agreeing on essentials. Together they provide a rich, multidimensional portrait of Jesus Christ.

Matthew wrote for Jewish readers, presenting Jesus as Israel''s promised King. Mark wrote a fast-paced action account, likely for Roman readers, showing Jesus as the Suffering Servant. Luke, the physician, carefully researched and wrote for Gentiles, emphasizing Jesus'' compassion for outsiders. John wrote last, providing theological reflection and unique material, emphasizing Jesus'' deity and eternal life.

This month-long study reads through all four Gospels, highlighting each evangelist''s distinctive contribution. We''ll see Jesus through four sets of eyes, gaining appreciation for the one Lord portrayed in complementary ways. By month''s end, you''ll understand the Gospels'' relationships and be equipped to study Jesus'' life with depth and nuance.'
WHERE slug = 'gospels-30-days';

-- Hope and Final Victory
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'Christianity''s hope isn''t wishful thinking but confident expectation based on God''s promises and Christ''s resurrection. Because Jesus rose, we will rise. Because He conquered death, we will conquer death. Because He reigns now, He will reign forever. The outcome is certain; we await its consummation.

This hope isn''t passive escapism. The certainty of Christ''s victory motivates present faithfulness. Paul wrote, "Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain" (1 Corinthians 15:58). Our work matters precisely because it contributes to an eternal kingdom.

This study explores Christian hope: its basis (resurrection), its content (what we hope for), its function (how hope sustains), and its final fulfillment (what happens when Christ returns). In an age of despair, anxiety, and uncertainty, believers can possess unshakeable hope—not because circumstances are good but because our God is faithful and His victory is assured.'
WHERE slug = 'hope-final-victory';

-- Key Bible Stories 30 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The Bible isn''t primarily a collection of propositions but a story—God''s story of creating, losing, and redeeming a people for Himself. Within this grand narrative are countless individual stories: creation, flood, exodus, conquest, kingdom, exile, and return; Jesus'' birth, ministry, death, and resurrection; the church''s birth and mission.

Stories teach differently than commands. They show rather than tell, inviting us to see ourselves in the characters, their struggles, their failures, and their victories. Jesus taught primarily through parables—stories that reveal truth to those with ears to hear.

This month-long study walks through 30 key Bible stories in canonical order, showing how each contributes to the overall narrative. We''ll read familiar stories with fresh eyes, seeing connections we''ve missed and applications we''ve overlooked. By month''s end, you''ll have a firm grasp of the biblical storyline and its relevance for your own story.'

-- Leadership and Servanthood
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The world''s leadership model is top-down: leaders give orders, followers obey. Jesus inverted this: "The greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves... I am among you as one who serves" (Luke 22:26-27).

Servant leadership isn''t weakness but strength channeled for others'' benefit. It requires security—knowing your identity doesn''t depend on position or recognition. Jesus could wash feet because "he knew that the Father had put all things under his power" (John 13:3). From that security, He served.

This study examines servant leadership through biblical examples: Moses advocating for rebellious people, David caring for his men, Nehemiah working alongside the builders, Jesus training twelve ordinary men. We''ll apply these principles to various leadership contexts: home, church, workplace, and community. The goal is developing Jesus'' leadership posture: authority exercised through service.'

-- New Testament 90 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day1_context = 'The New Testament records the climax of biblical history: God''s Son entering creation, dying for sins, rising from death, and launching a movement that spans the globe. Its 27 books—Gospels, Acts, Epistles, and Revelation—were written within about 50 years (AD 45-95) by eyewitnesses or their close associates.

Reading the entire New Testament in 90 days requires roughly 10-15 minutes daily—manageable for most schedules. The immersive experience reveals connections that piece-meal reading misses. You''ll see how the Gospels'' story continues in Acts, how the Epistles apply gospel truths, and how Revelation consummates all themes.

This plan reads the New Testament in its traditional order, though not strictly chronologically. Daily readings are sized for consistent progress without overwhelming. By the end of three months, you''ll have encountered Jesus'' life, the church''s birth, apostolic teaching, and apocalyptic hope—the essential story that changed the world.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the meek inheriting the earth. Today we examine the fourth beatitude: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled" (Matthew 5:6).

Hunger and thirst are survival drives—you can''t ignore them. Jesus describes people who crave righteousness with that intensity. This isn''t casual interest but consuming desire. "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God" (Psalm 42:1).

The promise: they will be filled. Not "might be" but "will be." God satisfies those who genuinely seek Him. "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart" (Jeremiah 29:13). Today we examine our spiritual appetite: Do we hunger for God, or are we spiritually snacking?'

-- Day 6
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day6_context = 'Day 5 examined hungering for righteousness. Today we explore the fifth beatitude: "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy" (Matthew 5:7).

Mercy is compassion in action—seeing need and responding with help rather than judgment. It reflects God''s own character: "The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love" (Psalm 145:8).

Note the reciprocal pattern: the merciful receive mercy. This echoes the Lord''s Prayer: "Forgive us as we forgive." James warns: "Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!" (James 2:13). Today we examine our mercy quotient: How do we respond to those who don''t deserve compassion?'

-- Day 7
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day7_context = 'Day 6 explored showing mercy. Today we examine the sixth beatitude: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God" (Matthew 5:8).

Purity of heart isn''t sinlessness but singleness—an undivided heart wholly devoted to God. "Create in me a pure heart, O God" (Psalm 51:10). The impure heart serves multiple masters; the pure heart serves One.

The reward is staggering: seeing God. "Now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Purity of heart positions us for the ultimate blessing—beholding God Himself. Today we ask: What divides my heart? What competes for my singular devotion to God?'

-- Day 8
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day8_context = 'Day 7 explored purity of heart. Today we examine the seventh beatitude: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9).

Peacemaking isn''t passivity or conflict avoidance. It''s actively pursuing reconciliation—between people and God, and between people and people. Jesus is the ultimate peacemaker: "He himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier" (Ephesians 2:14).

Peacemakers are called "children of God" because they share the family trait. God made peace through the cross; His children extend that peace. Today we examine: Where might God be calling you to make peace? What reconciliation have you avoided?'
WHERE slug = 'beatitudes-9-days';

-- Day 9
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day9_context = 'We''ve journeyed through seven beatitudes. Today we reach the final two: persecution for righteousness and for Christ''s sake.

"Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness... Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven" (Matthew 5:10-12).

Persecution marks authentic discipleship. "Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted" (2 Timothy 3:12). The world crucified Jesus; His followers shouldn''t expect better treatment. Yet the reward is great—heaven''s honor for earth''s rejection. As you complete this study, which beatitudes challenge you most? Where do you need to grow?'

-- FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT 9 DAYS - Days 5-9
-- ============================================

-- Day 5
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored peace. Today we examine the fourth fruit: patience—longsuffering in the face of provocation.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... patience" (Galatians 5:22). The Greek word "makrothumia" literally means "long-tempered"—the opposite of short-tempered. It''s slow anger, extended tolerance, enduring provocation without retaliation.

God Himself models patience: "The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love" (Psalm 103:8). We''ve all tested His patience; now we extend patience to others. Today we examine specific relationships or situations that require supernatural patience—and ask the Spirit to produce it.'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 6
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day6_context = 'Day 5 explored patience. Today we examine two related fruits: kindness and goodness.

Kindness is gentle benevolence toward others—a disposition of warmth and generosity. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you" (Ephesians 4:32). Kindness was demonstrated supremely in Christ''s treatment of sinners.

Goodness goes further—it''s active benevolence, doing good even when kindness isn''t returned. "Let us not become weary in doing good" (Galatians 6:9). Today we look for opportunities to be kind and do good, especially to those who can''t repay us.'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 7
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day7_context = 'Day 6 explored kindness and goodness. Today we examine faithfulness—reliable trustworthiness over time.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... faithfulness" (Galatians 5:22). This is dependability—being the person others can count on. "A faithful person who can find?" (Proverbs 20:6). Faithfulness is rare and precious.

God''s faithfulness is our model: "Because of the LORD''s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness" (Lamentations 3:22-23). The Spirit produces in us the same reliability. Today we examine our commitments: Are we faithful in big things and small?'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 8
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day8_context = 'Day 7 explored faithfulness. Today we examine gentleness—meekness, strength under control.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... gentleness" (Galatians 5:23). This isn''t weakness but power restrained. A gentle person could react harshly but chooses not to. Jesus described Himself as "gentle and humble in heart" (Matthew 11:29)—yet He drove out moneychangers with a whip.

Gentleness especially shows when we''re wronged or when correcting others. "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently" (Galatians 6:1). Today we examine our responses: Do we react or respond? Do we crush or restore?'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 9
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day9_context = 'We''ve journeyed through eight fruits. Today we reach the final one: self-control—mastery over impulses.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... self-control" (Galatians 5:23). This governs appetites, emotions, and desires. The undisciplined person is "like a city whose walls are broken through" (Proverbs 25:28)—vulnerable to every attack.

Paul concluded: "Against such things there is no law" (Galatians 5:23). You''ll never be arrested for too much love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, or self-control! These fruits fulfill what law demanded but couldn''t produce. As you complete this study, which fruits need most cultivation? Ask the Spirit to grow them in you.'

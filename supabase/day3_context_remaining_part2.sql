-- Day 3 Context for Remaining Reading Plans - Part 2
-- Plans: Elijah-Elisha through Holy Spirit

-- Elijah and Elisha 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced Elijah and his turbulent times. Day 2 witnessed his dramatic confrontation at Mount Carmel. Today we see the prophet''s stunning collapse into despair.

After his greatest victory, Elijah ran for his life from Jezebel''s threats. Under a broom tree, he prayed to die: "I have had enough, LORD... Take my life" (1 Kings 19:4). The man who called fire from heaven now wanted the fire of his own life extinguished.

God''s response was tender, not rebuking: He sent food and rest, then met Elijah at Horeb in a gentle whisper rather than dramatic displays. God addressed both physical needs (exhaustion) and spiritual discouragement (feeling alone). Today we learn that even great servants of God struggle, and that God meets us in our lowest moments.'

-- Encouragement for Depression
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 acknowledged depression''s reality. Day 2 examined Psalm 42-43—honest expression of despair. Today we explore practical biblical strategies for dark seasons.

Depression often involves negative thought patterns that Scripture addresses. Paul wrote, "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right... think about such things" (Philippians 4:8). This isn''t positive thinking that denies reality, but redirecting thoughts toward truth.

Practical steps include: maintaining spiritual practices even when they feel empty; engaging community rather than isolating; caring for physical health (sleep, exercise, nutrition); and seeking professional help when needed. Depression isn''t spiritual failure—even prophets like Elijah and Jeremiah experienced it. Today we explore hope that sustains through darkness.'

-- Epistles 30 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the New Testament letters. Day 2 examined how to read epistles in their original context. Today we explore a major theme that runs through them: life in the Spirit.

The epistles were written to people living between Christ''s first and second comings—exactly where we are. They address how to live the Christian life now, empowered by the Holy Spirit. This isn''t self-improvement but supernatural transformation.

Romans 8, Galatians 5, and Ephesians 5 all describe Spirit-empowered living. We "walk by the Spirit" (Galatians 5:16), are "filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18), and set our minds "on what the Spirit desires" (Romans 8:5). Today we examine this central epistolary theme: Christian living isn''t difficult—it''s impossible without the Spirit.'
WHERE slug = 'epistles-30-days';

-- Faith and Trust 21 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced biblical faith. Day 2 examined faith''s foundation—God''s trustworthy character. Today we explore faith''s expression: obedience.

Hebrews 11 defines faith as "confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see" (v. 1). But notice how every example in that chapter involves action: Noah built, Abraham went, Moses refused, Rahab welcomed. Faith that doesn''t act isn''t faith at all (James 2:17).

Obedience is faith made visible. When we obey God''s commands, especially when they don''t make sense to us, we demonstrate trust in His wisdom and goodness. Today''s reading examines this connection between belief and behavior, showing that authentic faith always moves from conviction to action.'
WHERE slug = 'faith-and-trust-21';

-- Faith at Work
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced work as calling. Day 2 examined the doctrine of vocation—all legitimate work serves God. Today we address excellence: why Christians should be the best workers in any organization.

Whatever you do, Paul wrote, "work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters" (Colossians 3:23). Our ultimate boss is Christ, which elevates every task. This means no cutting corners, no half-hearted effort, no "good enough."

Excellence isn''t about perfectionism or workaholism but about honoring God through quality work. It creates opportunities for witness—people notice when Christians work with integrity and diligence. Today we explore how excellent work glorifies God and opens doors for gospel conversations.'
WHERE slug = 'faith-at-work';

-- Financial Wisdom 10 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 established biblical stewardship. Day 2 examined generous giving. Today we explore contentment—the antidote to financial anxiety.

Paul learned "the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want" (Philippians 4:12). This contentment wasn''t complacency but trust—knowing that God supplies every need according to His riches in glory.

The writer of Hebrews connected contentment to God''s promise: "Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ''Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you''" (Hebrews 13:5). Contentment flows from security in God, not bank accounts. Today we explore cultivating contentment in a culture of comparison.'
WHERE slug = 'financial-wisdom-10';

-- Forgiveness 10 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced forgiveness''s importance. Day 2 defined what forgiveness is and isn''t. Today we address the practical challenge: how to forgive when you don''t feel like it.

Forgiveness is a decision, not primarily a feeling. We choose to release the debt, trusting God for justice rather than seeking our own revenge. Feelings often follow, but sometimes slowly. The decision to forgive may need to be reaffirmed many times before emotions catch up.

Practically, forgiveness involves: acknowledging the wrong honestly (no minimizing), choosing to release the debt to God, praying for the offender''s good (Matthew 5:44), and refusing to dwell on or rehearse the offense. Today''s reading offers guidance for the ongoing process of walking out forgiveness.'
WHERE slug = 'forgiveness-10-days';

-- Forgiveness in Relationships
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the necessity of forgiveness. Day 2 examined barriers to forgiving. Today we explore reconciliation—how forgiveness relates to restored relationship.

Forgiveness and reconciliation are related but distinct. Forgiveness is one-sided—you can forgive someone who never apologizes. Reconciliation requires two parties willing to rebuild trust. God calls us to always forgive; reconciliation depends on the other person''s response.

Some relationships can be fully restored after forgiveness. Others require boundaries because the person remains unsafe. Wisdom discerns the difference. Today we explore navigating these distinctions—offering forgiveness freely while protecting appropriately.'
WHERE slug = 'forgiveness-relationships';

-- Friendship God''s Way
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced biblical friendship. Day 2 examined David and Jonathan''s covenant friendship. Today we explore the qualities that make friendships flourish.

Proverbs offers wisdom for friendship: "A friend loves at all times" (17:17). "Wounds from a friend can be trusted" (27:6). "One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother" (18:24).

Healthy friendships involve loyalty, honesty, availability, and mutual edification. They speak truth even when it''s uncomfortable, keep confidences, celebrate successes without jealousy, and mourn together in loss. Today''s reading examines these qualities and how to cultivate them in your relationships.'
WHERE slug = 'friendship-gods-way';

-- God''s Love 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the vastness of God''s love. Day 2 examined love demonstrated at the cross. Today we explore the security this love provides—nothing can separate us from it.

Romans 8:35-39 offers one of Scripture''s most powerful assurances: neither death nor life, angels nor demons, present nor future, height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation can separate us from God''s love in Christ Jesus. Paul isn''t speculating—he''s declaring what he tested through shipwrecks, beatings, and imprisonment.

This security doesn''t depend on our love for God, which wavers, but on His love for us, which doesn''t. We love because He first loved us (1 John 4:19). Today we rest in the unshakeable love that holds us when we cannot hold ourselves.'
WHERE slug = 'gods-love-14';

-- God''s Will for Life
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the question of discerning God''s will. Day 2 examined God''s revealed will in Scripture. Today we explore decision-making in areas where the Bible doesn''t give specific direction.

Much of God''s will is already revealed: "Be joyful always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances—for this is God''s will for you" (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18). When we''re doing the revealed will, we have freedom in non-commanded areas.

For specific decisions, consider: Does this align with Scripture? What is wise? What do godly advisors say? What circumstances suggest? What do you desire (since God often works through sanctified desires)? Peace after prayer can confirm direction. Today we learn that discerning God''s will involves both diligent seeking and restful trusting.'
WHERE slug = 'gods-will-for-life';

-- Gospels 30 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the four Gospels. Day 2 examined their different audiences and emphases. Today we discuss reading the Gospels devotionally—encountering Jesus, not just gathering information.

The Gospels aren''t merely historical records but invitations to relationship. John wrote his Gospel "that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31). The goal is life-giving faith, not academic knowledge.

As you read, ask: What does this reveal about Jesus? How does He treat people? What does He prioritize? How would I respond if I were there? Let the stories become windows into Jesus'' character. Today we learn to read not just about Jesus but with Jesus, letting His words become personal address.'
WHERE slug = 'gospels-30-days';

-- Grace vs Works
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the grace-works question. Day 2 established justification by grace through faith. Today we explore sanctification—if we''re saved by grace, what role do works play?

Works don''t contribute to our justification but they evidence it. James wrote, "Faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26). This doesn''t contradict Paul''s teaching on grace; James is addressing those who claim faith but show no fruit. Genuine faith produces good works.

Sanctification involves our effort—Paul says "work out your salvation with fear and trembling"—but only because "it is God who works in you" (Philippians 2:12-13). We work because God is working. Today we explore this dynamic partnership between divine grace and human response in the Christian life.'
WHERE slug = 'grace-vs-works';

-- Grief and Comfort 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 acknowledged grief''s reality. Day 2 examined God as the God of all comfort. Today we explore lament—the biblical practice of honest grief expression.

Over one-third of the Psalms are laments. They don''t pretend everything is fine; they pour out pain honestly to God. "How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1). "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1). This isn''t lack of faith—it''s faith expressed in honesty.

Lament has structure: address to God, complaint, confession of trust, petition, and often a vow of praise. It takes pain to God rather than away from Him. Today we learn that grief fully expressed to God becomes grief that heals.'
WHERE slug = 'grief-and-comfort-14';

-- Growing When Stuck
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 acknowledged the experience of spiritual stagnation. Day 2 examined possible causes—hidden sin, neglected disciplines, unconfessed doubt. Today we explore one specific remedy: spiritual friendship.

Growth rarely happens in isolation. "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another" (Proverbs 27:17). We need others to encourage us, challenge us, and hold us accountable. When stuck, we often need someone to speak truth we can''t see ourselves.

A spiritual friend or mentor can help diagnose what''s blocking growth, provide accountability for change, and encourage perseverance when progress is slow. Today''s reading examines the power of intentional Christian relationships for breaking through spiritual plateaus.'
WHERE slug = 'growing-when-stuck';

-- Heaven, Hell, Eternity
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced biblical teaching on eternity. Day 2 examined heaven—what Scripture reveals about our eternal home. Today we confront a difficult doctrine: hell.

Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone in Scripture. He described it as a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, outer darkness, eternal fire, and separation from God. Whatever these images mean precisely, they describe a terrible reality Jesus died to save us from.

Hell exists because humans have real moral significance. Our choices matter eternally. God respects human freedom even when it''s used to reject Him. C.S. Lewis wrote, "The doors of hell are locked from the inside." Today we examine this sobering doctrine with both reverence and motivation for evangelism.'
WHERE slug = 'heaven-hell-eternity';

-- Holiness in Broken World
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced holiness as God''s call. Day 2 examined what holiness means—being set apart for God. Today we explore the practical question: how do we live holy lives in an unholy world?

Peter wrote to scattered believers: "Just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do" (1 Peter 1:15). But how? Not by monastic withdrawal but by engaged distinctiveness—being in the world but not of it (John 17:14-16).

Holiness involves both separation (from sin) and dedication (to God). It''s maintained through Scripture, prayer, fellowship, and the Spirit''s power. It shows up in the ordinary: honest work, faithful marriage, clean speech, generous giving. Today we explore holiness as everyday faithfulness, not just crisis resistance.'
WHERE slug = 'holiness-broken-world';

-- Holy Spirit 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced the Holy Spirit as the third Person of the Trinity. Day 2 examined His deity and personhood. Today we explore His work in salvation—how the Spirit brings us to Christ.

No one comes to Christ without the Spirit''s work. Jesus said, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them" (John 6:44). This drawing happens through the Spirit, who convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8).

The Spirit regenerates us—gives us new birth (John 3:5-8). He opens blind eyes, softens hard hearts, and enables dead sinners to respond to Christ. Even our faith is a gift (Ephesians 2:8). Today we marvel at the Spirit''s saving work and learn to cooperate with His convicting ministry in evangelism.'
WHERE slug = 'holy-spirit-14';

-- Hope and Final Victory
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced eschatological hope. Day 2 examined the certainty of Christ''s return. Today we explore what happens at that return—the resurrection of the dead.

"We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him" (1 Thessalonians 4:14). The dead in Christ will rise first, then living believers will be caught up together with them. This is our "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13).

The resurrection isn''t just spiritual survival but bodily transformation. We''ll receive glorified bodies like Christ''s resurrection body—physical yet immortal. Death, the last enemy, will be destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26). Today we find hope that conquers grief and transforms how we face mortality.'
WHERE slug = 'hope-final-victory';

-- Hope in Hard Times 10 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced biblical hope. Day 2 examined hope''s foundation—God''s character and promises. Today we explore how hope is cultivated through trials themselves.

Paul wrote a surprising sequence: "Suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope" (Romans 5:3-4). Hope actually grows through difficulty, not despite it. How?

When we persevere through trials, we discover God''s faithfulness experientially, not just theoretically. Each test survived builds confidence for the next. Character developed in adversity becomes bedrock for hope. Today''s reading examines this counterintuitive process—how the very difficulties that threaten hope can actually deepen it.'
WHERE slug = 'hope-in-hard-times-10';

-- Hope in Suffering
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 acknowledged suffering''s reality. Day 2 explored Scripture''s honest engagement with pain. Today we examine a profound truth: God works through suffering.

"We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him" (Romans 8:28). This doesn''t mean everything is good, but that God works even evil for good purposes. Joseph told his brothers, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:20).

Suffering can produce character that comfort never could. It can deepen compassion, clarify priorities, expose idols, and drive us to God. None of this makes suffering good or easy, but it reveals that suffering is never meaningless for those who trust God. Today we explore redemptive suffering.'
WHERE slug = 'hope-in-suffering';

-- Humility and Obedience
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day3_context = 'Day 1 introduced humility as foundation for the Christian life. Day 2 examined Christ''s supreme example of humility. Today we explore the connection between humility and obedience.

Jesus "humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross" (Philippians 2:8). Humility enabled obedience; obedience expressed humility. Pride resists God''s commands; humility receives them as good.

To obey means to submit our judgment to Another''s—to trust that God''s ways are better than ours. This requires humility. "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). Today we see how humility opens the door to the obedience that leads to blessing.'

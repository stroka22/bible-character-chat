UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored communication in marriage. Today we examine conflict—every marriage has it.

"In your anger do not sin" (Ephesians 4:26). Conflict isn''t sin; how we handle it matters. Fight fair: address issues, not attack persons.

"A gentle answer turns away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). Today we develop healthy conflict patterns.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed conflict. Today we examine forgiveness in marriage—essential for longevity.

"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone" (Colossians 3:13). Marriage accumulates hurts. Without forgiveness, resentment builds.

Forgiveness is decision, not feeling. Today we practice marital forgiveness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored forgiveness. Today we examine intimacy—physical, emotional, spiritual connection.

"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband" (1 Corinthians 7:3). Sexual intimacy is good, expected, and mutual in marriage.

But intimacy is more than physical—emotional vulnerability and spiritual partnership complete the picture. Today we pursue full intimacy.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored intimacy. Today we examine seasons of marriage—it changes over time.

Newlywed passion, parenting exhaustion, empty-nest adjustment, aging together—each season has unique challenges and gifts.

"There is a time for everything" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Today we navigate or anticipate marriage seasons.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored seasons. Today we examine protecting marriage—it faces real threats.

Threats include: neglect, outside attractions, busyness, in-law issues, and financial stress. Marriage requires intentional protection.

"Above all else, guard your heart" (Proverbs 4:23). Today we identify and address threats.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored protection. Today we examine serving each other—marriage as mutual ministry.

"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Ephesians 5:21). Before specific role instructions, mutual submission is called for.

Servant marriage asks "How can I serve?" not "What do I get?" Today we cultivate servant hearts.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored serving. Today we examine praying together—spiritual partnership.

"Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives... so that nothing will hinder your prayers" (1 Peter 3:7). Marriage and prayer are connected.

Couples who pray together report stronger marriages. Today we pray with our spouses.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored praying together. Today we examine growing together—becoming better together.

"Two are better than one" (Ecclesiastes 4:9). Healthy marriages make both partners better.

Growing together requires: shared goals, mutual encouragement, honest feedback, and celebrating each other''s growth. Today we evaluate—growing together or apart?',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored growing together. Today we examine legacy—what your marriage passes on.

Your marriage teaches children what marriage looks like. It witnesses to the watching world. It either commends or undermines the gospel picture it represents.

"Grandchildren are the crown of the aged" (Proverbs 17:6). Today we consider multi-generational impact.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored biblical love and marriage: God''s design, love''s portrait, roles, communication, conflict, forgiveness, intimacy, seasons, protection, serving, praying, growing, and legacy.

"This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32).

As you complete this study, what will change? Marriage is worth the investment. It pictures the gospel.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the instruction side. Today we examine the modeling side—children learn by watching.

"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" (1 Corinthians 11:1). Can you say this to your children?

Children absorb what they see. If we want praying children, they must see us pray. If we want honest children, they must hear us tell truth. Today we examine what our lives teach.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored modeling. Today we examine age-appropriate parenting—children are not mini-adults.

"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child" (1 Corinthians 13:11). Expectations and methods should fit developmental stages.

Toddlers need different parenting than teenagers. Today we adapt to developmental realities.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed developmental stages. Today we examine protection—keeping children safe.

"If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck" (Matthew 18:6). Children need protection.

Protection includes: monitoring media, screening relationships, creating safe home environments, and teaching discernment. Today we assess protective practices.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored protection. Today we examine releasing—the goal is launch.

"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother" (Genesis 2:24). Leaving is the goal. We raise children to leave well.

This requires progressively releasing control, allowing age-appropriate decisions and consequences, and preparing for independence. Today we balance holding and releasing.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored releasing. Today we examine praying for children—our most important practice.

Job regularly offered sacrifices for his children "thinking, ''Perhaps my children have sinned''" (Job 1:5). Covering children in prayer was his custom.

We can''t control their choices, but we can pray. Today we develop prayer habits for our children.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored prayer. Today we address prodigals—when children wander.

The prodigal''s father never stopped watching, hoping, and waiting. Some children wander despite faithful parenting.

Keep praying, keep the door open, maintain relationship without enabling sin. The story isn''t over until it''s over. Today we find hope for wandering children.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed prodigals. Today we examine encouragement—building up children.

"Fathers, do not exasperate your children" (Ephesians 6:4). Constant criticism, unrealistic expectations, and comparison exasperate.

"Encourage one another daily" (Hebrews 3:13). Children flourish with encouragement. Today we build up our children.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored encouragement. Today we examine consistency—children need predictability.

"Let your ''Yes'' be yes, and your ''No,'' no" (James 5:12). Follow-through matters. Inconsistent boundaries confuse.

Consistency in rules, consequences, and affection creates security. Today we pursue consistent parenting.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored consistency. Today we address special circumstances—single parents, blended families, special needs.

Not every family looks the same. Single parents carry double loads. Blended families navigate complexity. Special needs require adaptation.

God is "a father to the fatherless" (Psalm 68:5). He helps the vulnerable. Today we acknowledge diverse family realities.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored parenting: stewardship, faith transmission, discipline, instruction, modeling, developmental stages, protection, releasing, prayer, prodigals, encouragement, consistency, and special circumstances.

"Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him" (Psalm 127:3).

As you complete this study, what will you implement? Parenting is hard; grace is sufficient. Raise them for His glory.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored vision. Today we examine communication—leaders must convey vision clearly.

Nehemiah communicated simply: "You see the trouble we are in... Come, let us rebuild." Response: "Let us start rebuilding" (Nehemiah 2:17-18). Clear communication produces united action.

Good communication includes clarity, inspiration, and repetition. Today we develop communication skills.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined communication. Today we explore decision-making—leaders face constant choices.

Moses was advised to delegate decisions, handling only difficult cases himself (Exodus 18:22). Wise leaders know what to decide and what to delegate.

Decision wisdom includes: gathering information, seeking counsel, praying, and acting decisively. Today we develop decision processes.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored decisions. Today we examine handling criticism—it comes with leadership.

Moses faced constant criticism. David was mocked. Jesus was slandered. Leaders attract criticism.

Listen for legitimate concerns, ignore unfounded attacks, maintain focus. "A gentle answer turns away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). Today we build resilience.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed criticism. Today we explore developing others—leaders multiply themselves.

Jesus invested three years in twelve. Paul invested in Timothy, Titus, and others. Good leaders develop future leaders.

"The things you have heard me say... entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Today we commit to developing others.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined development. Today we explore leading change—it''s always challenging.

Nehemiah led change against opposition. Change produces resistance; leaders must navigate it.

Change leadership includes: communicating why change is necessary, involving people, addressing concerns, and maintaining patience. Today we develop change leadership skills.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored change. Today we examine self-leadership—leading yourself first.

"I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified" (1 Corinthians 9:27). Self-leadership precedes public leadership.

Self-leadership includes: time management, maintaining disciplines, guarding heart, and resting appropriately. Today we assess self-leadership.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored self-leadership. Today we address crisis leadership—when everything goes wrong.

Nehemiah faced crisis: enemies threatened, workers despaired. His response: "Remember the Lord... and fight" (Nehemiah 4:14). Prayer and action.

Crisis leadership requires: staying calm, communicating clearly, making decisions, and maintaining hope. Today we prepare for crisis.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed crisis. Today we examine team leadership—accomplishing together.

Jesus chose twelve. Nehemiah organized workers by groups. Paul traveled with teams. Teams accomplish more than individuals.

Team leadership includes: choosing right people, clarifying roles, empowering action, and celebrating wins. Today we develop team skills.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored teams. Today we address succession—good leaders prepare replacements.

Moses invested in Joshua. Elijah mentored Elisha. Paul developed Timothy. Leaders who don''t plan succession leave vacuums.

"Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). Vision needs successors. Today we plan for succession.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored servant leadership: Jesus'' model, character, vision, communication, decisions, criticism, developing others, change, self-leadership, crisis, teams, and succession.

"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant" (Matthew 20:26).

As you complete this study, what will you implement? Lead like Jesus—with character, service, and vision.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored God''s unique design. Today we examine gifts—abilities the Spirit gives for service.

"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them" (1 Corinthians 12:4). Every believer has gifts for serving the body.

Discovering purpose involves discovering gifts. What abilities has the Spirit given you? Today we identify spiritual gifts.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored gifts. Today we examine passions—what burdens your heart?

Nehemiah wept over Jerusalem''s walls. Paul agonized over his kinsmen''s salvation. God-given passion often points to purpose.

What moves you? What injustice angers you? What need compels you? Today we identify holy passions.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored passions. Today we examine experiences—how has God prepared you?

Joseph''s suffering prepared him to save Egypt. Moses'' wilderness years prepared him to lead through wilderness. Your experiences equip you.

What has life taught you? What have you survived? How might that serve others? Today we see experience as preparation.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored experiences. Today we examine opportunities—where are the open doors?

"I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut" (Revelation 3:8). God opens doors. Purpose often involves walking through them.

What opportunities are before you? What doors might God be opening? Today we identify opportunities.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored opportunities. Today we examine community confirmation—others see what we might miss.

"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" (Proverbs 15:22). Others can confirm or redirect our sense of purpose.

What do others see in you? What do they affirm? Today we seek community input.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored community confirmation. Today we address false purposes—what masquerades as purpose.

Some pursue: success (achievement measured by worldly standards), approval (living for others'' opinions), comfort (avoiding discomfort), or control (managing outcomes).

These counterfeit purposes distract from real ones. Today we identify false purposes.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed false purposes. Today we explore purpose and seasons—it changes over time.

Moses'' purpose looked different at 40 than at 80. David''s calling shifted from shepherd to warrior to king. Purpose has seasons.

"There is a time for everything" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). What is your purpose in this season? Today we embrace seasonal purpose.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored seasons. Today we address obstacles to purpose—what holds us back.

Fear says "What if I fail?" Comparison says "They''re better." Past failure says "You already blew it." Busyness says "No time."

"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13). Today we confront obstacles.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 confronted obstacles. Today we examine living purpose daily—translating calling to calendar.

Purpose isn''t just big picture but daily decisions. How does purpose shape your Monday? Your spending? Your relationships?

"Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). Today we connect purpose to practice.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored purpose: its existence, our design, gifts, passions, experiences, opportunities, community confirmation, false purposes, seasons, obstacles, and daily living.

"We are God''s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do" (Ephesians 2:10).

As you complete this study, what has become clearer? Purpose is real. Live yours.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 introduced specific gifts. Today we examine serving gifts—practical help that meets needs.

"If it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach" (Romans 12:7). Some are gifted to serve practically—noticing needs and meeting them.

This gift isn''t glamorous but essential. Today we honor and identify serving gifts.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored serving. Today we examine teaching gifts—explaining truth clearly.

"If it is teaching, then teach" (Romans 12:7). Teachers take complex truth and make it understandable. They love accuracy and clarity.

"Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly" (James 3:1). Today we examine teaching gifts.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored teaching. Today we examine encouraging gifts—strengthening others.

"If it is to encourage, then give encouragement" (Romans 12:8). Encouragers see potential, speak hope, and lift spirits.

Barnabas means "son of encouragement" (Acts 4:36). He encouraged the early church, sponsored Paul, and restored Mark. Today we honor encouragement gifts.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored encouragement. Today we examine giving gifts—generosity that flows freely.

"If it is giving, then give generously" (Romans 12:8). Some have unusual capacity for generosity—they see needs and have ability and willingness to meet them.

Giving gifts fund ministry. Today we honor and examine giving gifts.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored giving. Today we examine leadership gifts—governing with diligence.

"If it is to lead, do it diligently" (Romans 12:8). Some have capacity to organize, direct, and mobilize others toward goals.

Leadership gifts require character alongside capacity. Today we examine leadership gifts.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored leadership. Today we examine mercy gifts—showing compassion.

"If it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully" (Romans 12:8). Mercy sees suffering and responds with compassion—not duty but genuine care.

Mercy gifts often minister to the overlooked—sick, grieving, marginalized. Today we honor mercy gifts.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored mercy. Today we examine more dramatic gifts—prophecy, tongues, healing.

"To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge... to another faith... to another gifts of healing, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues" (1 Corinthians 12:8-10).

Christians disagree about how these gifts function today. Today we examine them with humility.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored more dramatic gifts. Today we address discovering your gifts—how do you know?

Clues include: what do you enjoy doing? What bears fruit? What do others affirm? What opportunities keep arising?

Spiritual gift inventories can help, but real ministry reveals real gifts. Today we pursue gift discovery.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored discovery. Today we address deploying your gifts—use them or lose them.

"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God''s grace" (1 Peter 4:10). Gifts unused are stewardship failed.

Where will you deploy your gifts? In church? In community? In workplace? Today we plan gift deployment.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored spiritual gifts: their purpose, unity and diversity, body metaphor, specific gifts (serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, mercy, and more), discovering, and deploying.

"Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it" (1 Corinthians 12:27).

As you complete this study, do you know your gifts? Are you using them? The body needs you.'

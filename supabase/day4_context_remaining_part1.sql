-- Plans: 1 Corinthians through Epistles

-- 1 Corinthians 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored the message of the cross as God''s power. Today we examine another problem in Corinth: divisions over church leaders.

The Corinthians formed factions: "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas" (1 Corinthians 1:12). They treated spiritual leaders like rival philosophers competing for disciples. Paul''s response: leaders are merely servants through whom you believed (3:5).

"I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow" (3:6). Neither planter nor waterer matters—only God who gives growth. Church leaders are stewards, not celebrities. Today we learn to appreciate leaders without idolizing them, recognizing that Christ alone deserves our ultimate allegiance.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored the 400 years of silence between Testaments. Today we witness the breaking of that silence: the announcement to Zechariah.

An elderly priest burning incense in the temple encounters Gabriel—no angelic visitor for four centuries, and now this. Zechariah and Elizabeth would have a son who would "make ready a people prepared for the Lord" (Luke 1:17). The forerunner was coming.

Zechariah doubted and was struck mute—a sign and discipline. For nine months he pondered in silence what he couldn''t yet proclaim. When his tongue was loosed at John''s naming, he prophesied of the "rising sun" coming from heaven. Today we see God breaking into history, preparing the way.'

-- Armor of God 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined the belt of truth. Today we explore the breastplate of righteousness—protection for the vital organs of faith.

The breastplate covered the heart and other vital organs. Righteousness—both Christ''s imputed righteousness and our lived-out integrity—protects our spiritual vitals from enemy attack.

Satan''s favorite weapon is accusation: "You''re a hypocrite. You call yourself a Christian? Look at your failures." The breastplate answers: "Yes, I fail, but Christ''s righteousness is mine by faith." We also give the enemy less ammunition by pursuing practical righteousness in daily life. Today we learn to don righteousness both positional and practical.'
WHERE slug = 'armor-of-god-7';

-- Authority of Scripture
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined inerrancy—the Bible''s complete truthfulness. Today we explore sufficiency: Scripture contains everything we need for faith and godliness.

Peter wrote that God''s divine power "has given us everything we need for a godly life" through our knowledge of Christ revealed in Scripture (2 Peter 1:3). We don''t need new revelations; the Bible is sufficient.

This doesn''t mean Scripture addresses every topic (it doesn''t tell us how to fix cars) but that it provides what we need for knowing God and living rightly. When facing decisions, difficulties, or doctrinal questions, Scripture is our sufficient guide. Today we explore what sufficiency means and how it shapes our approach to life''s challenges.'

-- Bearing Fruit That Lasts
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined what spiritual fruit looks like. Today we explore an essential condition for fruit-bearing: pruning.

Jesus said the Father "cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful" (John 15:2). Even fruitful branches need pruning.

Pruning hurts. It involves cutting away what seems good for what''s better. God removes comfortable situations, prunes relationships, cuts back activities—not to harm us but to increase fruitfulness. Difficulties are often divine pruning. Today we learn to cooperate with the Gardener''s cuts, trusting His wisdom even when it hurts.'
WHERE slug = 'bearing-fruit-lasts';

-- Beatitudes 9 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored "blessed are those who mourn." Today we examine the third beatitude: "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5).

Meekness isn''t weakness. Moses was "more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3), yet he confronted Pharaoh, led a nation, and received God''s law. Meekness is strength under control—power submitted to proper authority.

The world says the aggressive inherit the earth. Jesus says the meek do. Those who don''t grasp and grab but trust God for vindication and provision will ultimately possess everything. Today we explore this countercultural virtue that inherits what grasping can never obtain.'
WHERE slug = 'beatitudes-9-days';

-- Bible in 30 Minutes a Day
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 addressed reading when you don''t feel like it. Today we explore reading comprehensively: how to understand what you''re reading.

Reading without understanding is just moving your eyes. Active reading involves asking questions: Who wrote this and to whom? What''s the main point? What does this teach about God? About humanity? How does this connect to Christ? What should I do?

Keep a simple journal: write the reference, one insight, and one application. This forces engagement beyond passive reading. You don''t need scholarly resources—just curiosity and the Spirit''s help. Today we develop practices for comprehension that transforms reading into learning.'
WHERE slug = 'bible-30-minutes-day';

-- Bible for Busy Christians
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored integration—weaving Scripture throughout your day. Today we examine the fruit of consistent engagement: transformation over time.

Scripture reading isn''t about checking boxes but about becoming different people. "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says" (James 1:22). The goal is life change, not just information transfer.

Transformation happens gradually—line upon line, day after day. You may not notice growth in a week, but over months and years, Scripture shapes thinking, reshapes reactions, and reorders priorities. Trust the process even when you don''t feel different immediately. Today we embrace the long view of Scripture''s transforming power.'
WHERE slug = 'bible-busy-christians';

-- Bible and End Times
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored signs of the times. Today we examine different views Christians hold about the end times—with humility about our disagreements.

Bible-believing Christians disagree about end-times details: pre-, mid-, or post-tribulation rapture; premillennial, amillennial, or postmillennial return; and the meaning of Revelation''s symbols. These are secondary issues where faithful Christians interpret prophecy differently.

What all agree on: Christ will return bodily and visibly; there will be judgment and resurrection; God''s people will dwell with Him forever; evil will be finally defeated. Today we explore various views charitably, recognizing that humility about prophetic interpretation is appropriate.'
WHERE slug = 'bible-end-times';

-- Bible Overview 60 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined the fall in Genesis 3. Today we witness God''s response: the promise of redemption and the beginning of grace.

Even before pronouncing judgment, God sought the hiding couple: "Where are you?" (Genesis 3:9). This question reveals God''s pursuing heart. Then, within the curse on the serpent, God embedded promise: the woman''s seed would crush the serpent''s head (3:15).

God also "made garments of skin" for Adam and Eve (3:21)—implying animal death to cover human shame. The pattern of blood covering sin begins immediately. Today we see that grace appears on the same page as sin. God''s response to human failure has always been redemptive pursuit.'
WHERE slug = 'bible-overview-60';

-- Biblical Leadership 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 emphasized character over competence. Today we explore vision: leaders must know where they''re going and communicate it compellingly.

"Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). Leaders see what could be and call others toward it. Nehemiah saw rebuilt walls when others saw rubble. Jesus called disciples to fish for people when they only knew catching fish.

Vision isn''t daydreaming but Spirit-directed sight. It answers: What is God doing? Where is He leading? What does the future look like if we''re faithful? Today we explore how leaders discern and communicate vision that mobilizes others toward God''s purposes.'
WHERE slug = 'biblical-leadership-14';

-- Biblical Love and Marriage
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined communication. Today we explore conflict: every marriage has it, and how you handle it determines whether your relationship grows or erodes.

Scripture gives principles: "In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry" (Ephesians 4:26). Anger isn''t always sinful, but unresolved anger becomes bitterness. Address issues promptly but calmly.

"Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry" (James 1:19). In conflict, seek understanding before defending yourself. Ask, "Help me understand why you feel that way." Attack problems together rather than attacking each other. Today we explore constructive conflict that strengthens rather than damages marriages.'
WHERE slug = 'biblical-love-marriage';

-- Character of God
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored God''s love. Today we examine His sovereignty—He is in absolute control of all things.

"Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him" (Psalm 115:3). Nothing happens outside His permission; nothing surprises Him; nothing threatens His ultimate purposes. Even evil serves His sovereign plan, though He is never its author.

Sovereignty doesn''t mean God causes everything (some things He permits) or that we''re puppets (real choice exists). It means nothing is random, nothing is wasted, and God''s good purposes cannot be thwarted. Today we explore this comforting truth: your life is not at the mercy of chance but in the hands of the Almighty.'
WHERE slug = 'character-of-god';

-- Christmas Story 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 witnessed the birth in Bethlehem. Today we hear the angelic announcement to shepherds—and its surprising recipients.

Why shepherds? They were social outcasts—their occupation made them ceremonially unclean and prevented religious observance. Yet heaven''s first birth announcement went to these outsiders: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests" (Luke 2:14).

The King of glory chose the lowly as His first witnesses. This pattern continues throughout Jesus''s ministry—He came for sinners, not the self-righteous; the sick, not those who think they''re healthy. Today we see that the gospel is for the marginalized, the unlikely, the overlooked.'
WHERE slug = 'christmas-story-7';

-- Conflict Resolution Biblical
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored self-examination before confrontation. Today we learn how to confront when self-examination is complete.

Jesus gave instructions: "If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you" (Matthew 18:15). Note: go privately first. Don''t gossip, don''t triangulate, don''t avoid. Go directly, gently, and with hope for restoration.

Effective confrontation: choose the right time and place; state the issue specifically; describe impact without attacking character; listen to their perspective; and seek resolution, not victory. The goal is reconciliation, not winning arguments. Today we learn to speak truth in love for restoration.'
WHERE slug = 'conflict-resolution-biblical';

-- Covenants of Bible
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored the Abrahamic covenant. Today we examine the Mosaic covenant given at Sinai—a covenant that shaped Israel''s national identity.

After rescuing Israel from Egypt, God gave the Law through Moses. This covenant was conditional: "If you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession" (Exodus 19:5). Blessings for obedience, curses for disobedience were spelled out in detail.

The Mosaic covenant wasn''t a way of salvation but a way of life for those already redeemed (they were saved from Egypt first, then given the Law). It revealed God''s character, exposed human inability to keep it perfectly, and pointed forward to a better covenant. Today we explore Sinai''s significance and limitations.'
WHERE slug = 'covenants-of-bible';

-- Creation, Fall, Promise
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined the promise within the curse. Today we explore another theme: covering and clothing—God''s provision for shame.

Adam and Eve made fig-leaf coverings, but God provided "garments of skin" (Genesis 3:21). Their self-made covering was inadequate; God''s covering required death. Here begins the pattern: human attempts to cover sin fail; God provides covering at the cost of blood.

This points forward to Christ, "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). His blood provides the ultimate covering—not just for shame but for sin itself. Today we see in Eden''s garden the shadow of Calvary''s cross.'
WHERE slug = 'creation-fall-promise';

-- Daily Proverbs and Psalms
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored the Psalms'' emotional honesty. Today we dig deeper into Proverbs'' wisdom method: the fear of the Lord.

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10). This isn''t terror but reverent awe—recognizing who God is and ordering life accordingly. Wisdom begins not with IQ but with right relationship to God.

Practical wisdom flows from theological foundation. When we understand that God is sovereign, holy, loving, and just, we live accordingly: honest in business because God sees; faithful in marriage because God cares; generous with money because it''s all His anyway. Today we see how the fear of the Lord produces practical wisdom.'

-- Daniel 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 witnessed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace. Today we see Nebuchadnezzar''s pride and dramatic humbling.

The great king boasted, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built?" (Daniel 4:30). Immediately, he lost his sanity and lived like an animal for seven years until he acknowledged that "the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms" (4:25).

God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Nebuchadnezzar learned this the hard way. Yet the story ends with restoration: when he acknowledged God''s sovereignty, his sanity and kingdom were restored. Today we see that God humbles the proud—but with redemptive purpose, not destructive intent.'
WHERE slug = 'daniel-14-days';

-- Discipleship Following Jesus
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored how disciples are made. Today we examine a core discipleship practice: obedience, not just information.

Jesus''s Great Commission was to make disciples, "teaching them to obey everything I have commanded" (Matthew 28:20). Not just teaching information but teaching obedience. Discipleship isn''t complete until truth becomes practice.

This is where many discipleship efforts fail. We transfer knowledge without transformation, information without application. True disciples don''t just know what Jesus said; they do it. "Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock" (Matthew 7:24). Today we examine obedience-based discipleship.'
WHERE slug = 'discipleship-following-jesus';

-- Discovering Purpose
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored discovering your unique calling. Today we address a common struggle: what if you can''t discern clear direction?

Sometimes God''s specific calling isn''t clear. What then? Remember: God''s revealed will (Scripture) is always clear even when His specific will (which job, which city) isn''t. Focus on what you know while waiting for what you don''t.

Also, God often guides through open doors and closed ones, through desires He shapes, through circumstances He arranges, and through counsel from others. Keep walking, keep serving, keep praying—and direction often emerges in the journey. Today we learn to move forward faithfully even when the path isn''t fully visible.'

-- Easter Journey 7 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 examined the Last Supper. Today we enter Gethsemane—the garden of anguish where Jesus wrestled with the cup before Him.

"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," Jesus told His disciples. "Stay here and keep watch" (Mark 14:34). Then He fell to the ground and prayed: "Abba, Father... Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will" (14:36).

What was in that cup? The full weight of human sin, the wrath of God against it, separation from the Father He had known eternally. Jesus faced this honestly—not with stoic indifference but with agonized submission. Today we witness the cost our salvation required.'
WHERE slug = 'easter-journey-7';

-- Elijah and Elisha 14 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 witnessed Elijah''s collapse into despair. Today we see God''s tender restoration and new commission.

At Horeb, God didn''t appear in wind, earthquake, or fire but in "a gentle whisper" (1 Kings 19:12). He asked again, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" Then He gave new assignments: anoint new kings and anoint Elisha as successor.

God''s cure for Elijah''s despair included: physical rest and food, fresh encounter with God, perspective correction (7,000 faithful remained), and renewed purpose. Depression wasn''t permanent; ministry wasn''t over. Today we see that God restores His weary servants and gives them fresh vision for the future.'
WHERE slug = 'elijah-elisha-14';

-- Encouragement for Depression
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored practical strategies. Today we examine the importance of community—not facing depression alone.

Depression often drives isolation: we withdraw, hide, and suffer silently. But "two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). Community provides what isolation cannot: perspective, encouragement, practical help, and accountability.

This might mean: confiding in a trusted friend, joining a support group, seeing a counselor, or simply accepting help when offered. "Carry each other''s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2). Today we embrace the truth that healing often happens in community.'

-- Epistles 30 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day4_context = 'Day 3 explored life in the Spirit as a major epistolary theme. Today we examine another: the already/not yet tension of Christian existence.

The epistles were written to people living between Christ''s resurrection and return—already saved but not yet glorified; already citizens of heaven but still living on earth; already new creations but still struggling with sin. This tension pervades the letters.

Understanding this helps interpretation: we really are saints (positionally) even while we still sin. Victory is ours in Christ, yet we still fight battles. The kingdom has come, yet we pray "your kingdom come." Today we learn to live faithfully in the tension between what is already ours and what is not yet fully realized.'

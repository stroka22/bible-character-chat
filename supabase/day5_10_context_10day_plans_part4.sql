-- NEAR TO THE BROKENHEARTED
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored brokenness producing compassion. Today we examine the gift of lament—permission to grieve.

Over one-third of Psalms are laments. They don''t pretend everything is fine; they pour out pain honestly. "How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1). This isn''t lack of faith—it''s faith expressed honestly.

Lament has structure: address to God, complaint, trust expression, petition, and often praise. It takes pain to God rather than away from Him. Grief expressed to God becomes grief that heals. Today we learn to lament biblically.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored lament. Today we address unanswered questions: when brokenness persists and answers don''t come.

Job never learned why he suffered. He received God''s presence but not explanations. Sometimes we won''t understand until heaven—if then.

"We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him" (Romans 8:28). We know God is working even when we can''t see how. Faith trusts His character when circumstances don''t make sense. Today we practice trusting without understanding.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed unanswered questions. Today we explore community in brokenness—we need each other.

"Carry each other''s burdens" (Galatians 6:2). The brokenhearted need others: to listen, to be present, to pray, to help practically. Isolation makes brokenness worse; community makes it bearable.

This requires vulnerability—admitting we''re broken. It also requires availability—making time for broken friends. "Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn" (Romans 12:15). Today we examine both giving and receiving support in community.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 emphasized community. Today we explore moving forward—how healing progresses without forgetting.

Healing doesn''t mean forgetting or pretending the pain didn''t happen. It means integrating the experience into who we''re becoming. Scars remain but no longer dominate.

"See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?" (Isaiah 43:19). God specializes in new beginnings. The brokenhearted can hope again, love again, trust again—carefully, gradually, but genuinely. Today we look for signs of new growth.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored moving forward. Today we examine purpose in pain—how God redeems brokenness for others'' good.

Joseph told his brothers: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:20). God doesn''t waste pain. What broke us often becomes our ministry to others.

Paul wrote: "The God of all comfort... comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). Your brokenness qualifies you to minister to the similarly broken. Today we consider how God might use our pain.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored God''s nearness, lament, unanswered questions, community, moving forward, and purpose in pain. Today we trust the Healer.

"He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds" (Psalm 147:3). God is the healer. Our role is coming to Him, receiving His comfort, and walking forward with Him.

As you complete this study, where are you in the healing journey? What support do you need? How might God use your experience? The Lord is near to the brokenhearted. Draw near to Him.'
WHERE slug = 'near-to-brokenhearted';

-- STANDING FIRM UNDER PRESSURE
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined eternal perspective. Today we explore standing firm through the Spirit''s power—not our strength.

"Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD Almighty" (Zechariah 4:6). Standing firm requires supernatural strength. Our resolve cracks; His doesn''t.

"I can do all this through him who gives me strength" (Philippians 4:13). Notice: through Him, not by ourselves. We don''t grit our teeth and try harder; we depend on the Spirit''s enabling. Today we shift from self-effort to Spirit-dependence.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 emphasized Spirit-dependence. Today we explore the word of God as weapon—Scripture in pressure situations.

Jesus faced Satan''s temptation with Scripture: "It is written..." (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10). The "sword of the Spirit" is "the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17). Scripture memorized becomes ammunition available under pressure.

When pressured to compromise, having truth ready enables resistance. "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11). Today we identify Scriptures to memorize for our specific pressure points.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined Scripture as weapon. Today we address standing firm together—community strength.

"Two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). Isolated Christians fall more easily. Community provides accountability, encouragement, and strength in numbers.

Daniel stood firm with friends—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shared his convictions. They reinforced each other''s resolve. Who stands with you? Who do you stand with? Today we strengthen community connections.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 emphasized community. Today we explore counting the cost—being realistic about pressure''s price.

Jesus said, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me" (Matthew 16:24). Discipleship costs. Standing firm may mean lost opportunities, damaged relationships, or material loss.

Counting the cost beforehand prevents surprise and regret later. "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won''t you first sit down and estimate the cost?" (Luke 14:28). Today we honestly assess what standing firm might cost—and confirm it''s worth it.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined counting the cost. Today we explore standing firm joyfully—not grimly enduring but genuinely thriving.

"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds" (James 1:2). Not joy because of trials but in them. This isn''t masochism but perspective: trials produce proven character.

Peter wrote that believers "are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy" even though suffering (1 Peter 1:6-8). Standing firm can be joyful because we know who wins in the end. Today we cultivate joy under pressure.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored strategies, Spirit-power, Scripture, community, cost-counting, and joy. Today we commit to standing.

"After you have done everything, stand" (Ephesians 6:13). The goal is simple: when the pressure ends, still be standing. Not knocked down, not compromised, not defeated—standing.

As you complete this study, what pressures do you face? What preparations will you make? Who stands with you? "Stand firm. Let nothing move you" (1 Corinthians 15:58). The One who stands with you has already overcome the world.'
WHERE slug = 'standing-firm-pressure';

-- FRIENDSHIP GOD'S WAY
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored spiritual friendship. Today we examine the hard part of friendship: speaking truth even when difficult.

"Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses" (Proverbs 27:6). True friends tell us what we need to hear, not just what we want to hear. This requires courage and love.

"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow up into... Christ" (Ephesians 4:15). Truth without love wounds unnecessarily; love without truth enables destruction. Today we consider: Do we have friends who speak truth? Are we that friend to others?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined speaking truth. Today we explore loyalty—faithfulness through changing seasons.

"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity" (Proverbs 17:17). Fair-weather friends disappear when trouble comes. True friends stand closer in hard times.

Ruth''s loyalty to Naomi is legendary: "Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay" (Ruth 1:16). This commitment through difficulty defines friendship. Today we examine our loyalty: Do we stay when staying is hard?',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored loyalty. Today we address friendship boundaries—wisdom about how close to let people in.

Not everyone can be a close friend. Jesus had the twelve, but within them three (Peter, James, John), and within them one "whom Jesus loved." Intimacy requires capacity limits.

Some relationships are healthy at a distance but toxic up close. Wisdom discerns appropriate boundaries. "Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm" (Proverbs 13:20). Today we evaluate friendship boundaries—who to draw closer, who to love from further away.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed boundaries. Today we explore making new friends—the courage to initiate.

"A man who has friends must himself be friendly" (Proverbs 18:24 NKJV). Friendship requires initiative. Someone must extend first, risk rejection, and pursue connection.

Adults often find making new friends difficult. Busyness, self-consciousness, and established patterns work against new connections. Yet new friendships enrich life and expand God''s work in us. Today we consider who God might be calling us to pursue as a friend.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored making new friends. Today we examine being a good friend—what we bring to relationships.

"Do to others as you would have them do to you" (Luke 6:31). The Golden Rule applies to friendship. What do you want in a friend? Be that.

Good friends: listen more than talk, show up in crisis, keep confidences, celebrate others'' successes without jealousy, speak truth gently, forgive readily, and point each other to Christ. Today we honestly assess: What kind of friend am I?',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored friendship''s qualities, spiritual depth, truth-speaking, loyalty, boundaries, initiative, and self-examination. Today we commit to godly friendship.

"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor... A cord of three strands is not quickly broken" (Ecclesiastes 4:9, 12). The third strand is God—friendships centered on Him are strongest.

As you complete this study, what friendships need deepening? What new connections need initiating? What qualities need developing in yourself? Invest in godly friendships—they''re worth the effort.'
WHERE slug = 'friendship-gods-way';

-- SERVING LIKE JESUS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined practical service. Today we explore serving the undeserving—grace in action.

Jesus washed the feet of disciples who would abandon, deny, and betray Him. He knew what was coming yet served anyway. His service wasn''t based on recipients'' worthiness but on His character.

"While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). We serve not because people deserve it but because we''ve received undeserved grace. Today we consider serving those we might otherwise overlook or avoid.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed serving the undeserving. Today we examine serving faithfully when unnoticed—hidden service.

"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them" (Matthew 6:1). Some service is necessarily public, but our motivation shouldn''t be public recognition.

Jesus served in obscurity for thirty years before His public ministry. Hidden faithfulness prepared Him for visible impact. "Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you" (Matthew 6:4). Today we embrace hidden service that only God sees.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored hidden service. Today we address serving when tired—service that costs.

Jesus often served despite exhaustion. After learning of John the Baptist''s death, He sought solitude but was followed by crowds. "He had compassion on them and healed their sick" (Matthew 14:14). His fatigue didn''t eliminate His compassion.

We can''t serve everyone always—Jesus withdrew regularly. But we shouldn''t let discomfort always determine service. Sometimes we serve tired, inconvenienced, or stretched. Today we examine whether we serve only when convenient.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed serving tired. Today we explore serving through our gifts—matching ability with need.

"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God''s grace" (1 Peter 4:10). Effective service connects our gifts with others'' needs.

You can''t serve everyone in every way. But you can serve some people in some ways particularly well. What are you good at? What needs match those abilities? Today we identify service opportunities aligned with our gifts.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined serving through gifts. Today we explore serving together—team service is more effective than solo.

Jesus sent disciples "two by two" (Mark 6:7). The early church served together: "All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need" (Acts 2:44-45).

Team service: multiplies impact, provides accountability, encourages perseverance, and models community to those served. Today we consider serving alongside others rather than always alone.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored Jesus'' example, humility, practical service, serving the undeserving, hidden service, serving tired, gifts-based service, and team service. Today we commit to a servant life.

"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45). Jesus'' life was service; ours should be too.

As you complete this study, what specific service will you offer? Who will you serve this week? How will you develop as a servant? Follow Jesus in serving—it''s the path to true greatness.'
WHERE slug = 'serving-like-jesus';

-- UNITY IN BODY OF CHRIST
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored diversity within unity. Today we examine threats to unity—what divides and how to resist.

"I appeal to you, brothers and sisters... that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you" (1 Corinthians 1:10). Paul addressed real division over real issues.

Unity threats include: personality conflicts, doctrinal disputes over secondary matters, cultural differences, competition for resources or recognition, and gossip. Recognizing threats helps address them. Today we identify what threatens unity in our context.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 identified unity threats. Today we explore pursuing unity actively—it requires effort.

"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3). Unity doesn''t maintain itself; we must "make every effort."

Active pursuit includes: overlooking minor offenses, addressing major issues quickly, seeking understanding before judgment, choosing charitable interpretations, and prioritizing relationship over being right. Today we commit to active unity pursuit.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined active pursuit. Today we address unity amid disagreement—we won''t agree on everything.

Early Christians disagreed about meat, special days, and circumcision. Paul''s counsel: "Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters" (Romans 14:1). Distinguish essentials (non-negotiable) from non-essentials (where disagreement is permissible).

"In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity." This wisdom, attributed to various sources, captures biblical balance. Today we discern what''s essential and extend liberty elsewhere.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed disagreement. Today we explore unity''s witness—what it says to the watching world.

Jesus prayed "that all of them may be one... so that the world may believe" (John 17:21). Christian unity is evangelistic—it points others to Christ. Division, conversely, undermines witness.

"By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35). Our unity demonstrates gospel reality. The world notices how Christians treat each other. Today we consider how our unity (or disunity) affects witness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined unity''s witness. Today we explore reconciliation—restoring unity after it''s broken.

"First go and be reconciled to your brother or sister; then come and offer your gift" (Matthew 5:24). Broken relationships require initiative. Someone must move first.

Reconciliation includes: acknowledging wrong, asking forgiveness, releasing offenses, and rebuilding trust. It''s not pretending nothing happened but working through what did. Today we consider relationships needing reconciliation.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored unity''s basis, diversity, threats, active pursuit, disagreement navigation, witness, and reconciliation. Today we commit to being unity-builders.

"How good and pleasant it is when God''s people live together in unity!" (Psalm 133:1). Unity is both good (objectively right) and pleasant (experientially enjoyable).

As you complete this study, what role will you play in building unity? What divisions need addressing? What reconciliation needs pursuing? Be a unity-builder in Christ''s body.'

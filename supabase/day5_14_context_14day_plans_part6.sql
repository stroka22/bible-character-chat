SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined justification. Today we explore chapter 5—the benefits of justification.

"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God" (Romans 5:1). Peace replaces hostility. We''re no longer enemies but reconciled.

Through Adam, sin and death entered. Through Christ, grace and life abound. "Where sin increased, grace increased all the more" (5:20). Today we rejoice in justification''s benefits.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored justification''s benefits. Today we examine Romans 6—dead to sin, alive to God.

"Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus" (Romans 6:11). We''re not just forgiven; we''re transformed. The old self was crucified; we walk in newness of life.

This isn''t automatic—we must "count" or "reckon" it true. Today we appropriate our death to sin and life to God.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined death to sin. Today we explore Romans 7—the struggle with indwelling sin.

"I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing" (Romans 7:19). Paul articulates the frustrating struggle every believer knows.

This isn''t defeat but honesty. We''re saved, but sin still dwells in our members. The struggle is real—but so is victory. Today we face the tension honestly.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored the struggle. Today we reach Romans 8—perhaps Scripture''s greatest chapter.

"There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1). Chapter 8 answers chapter 7''s struggle: Spirit-empowered living brings freedom.

The Spirit gives life, bears witness to our adoption, helps our weakness, and guarantees our glorification. Nothing can separate us from God''s love. Today we soar in Romans 8.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 soared in Romans 8. Today we enter Romans 9-11—God''s plan for Israel.

These chapters address a difficult question: Has God''s word failed if Israel rejected their Messiah? Paul answers: God''s sovereignty is complete, Israel''s rejection opened the door for Gentiles, and all Israel will be saved.

"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" (11:33). Today we explore God''s mysterious but trustworthy plan.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored God''s plan for Israel. Today we begin Romans 12—living sacrifices.

"Offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship" (Romans 12:1). Theology becomes life. What we believe changes how we live.

The "therefore" of 12:1 connects to chapters 1-11: because of all God has done, this is our response. Today we present ourselves as living sacrifices.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored living sacrifices. Today we continue in Romans 12—the body functioning together.

"In Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others" (Romans 12:5). Different gifts, unified body. Prophecy, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, showing mercy—all needed.

The chapter concludes with instructions for community: genuine love, honoring others, sharing with the needy, living in peace. Today we function as body members.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored body functioning. Today we examine Romans 13—submission to authorities.

"Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established" (Romans 13:1). This verse has challenged Christians under unjust governments.

Paul''s point: Christians should be exemplary citizens, not rebels. We submit except when commands contradict God''s commands (Acts 5:29). Today we navigate submission and conscience.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored submission to authorities. Today we examine Romans 14-15—the weak and the strong.

"Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters" (Romans 14:1). Christians disagree on secondary issues. How do we handle this?

Don''t judge those who differ. Don''t cause others to stumble. "Each of us will give an account of ourselves to God" (14:12). Today we learn Christian tolerance on non-essentials.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Romans: human sinfulness, justification by faith, peace with God, death to sin, the struggle with sin, Spirit-empowered victory, God''s plan for Israel, living sacrifices, body life, submission, and handling disagreements.

"To God, the only wise God, be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen" (Romans 16:27).

As you complete this deep dive, what truths have transformed your thinking? What changes will you make? Romans reshapes how we understand salvation and how we live it out.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed the first missionary journey beginning. Today we see its expansion—Antioch of Pisidia.

In Pisidian Antioch, Paul preached in the synagogue. Initial response was enthusiastic; nearly the whole city gathered. But jealous Jews opposed him. Paul declared: "We now turn to the Gentiles" (Acts 13:46).

This pattern repeats: offer to Jews first, rejection by some, turning to Gentiles. Today we see the gospel crossing boundaries.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw the Gentile turn. Today we witness the Jerusalem Council—the first major church controversy resolved.

Must Gentile converts be circumcised? Some said yes. Paul and Barnabas were sent to Jerusalem. After discussion, Peter testified, Paul and Barnabas reported, and James concluded: "We should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God" (Acts 15:19).

Minimal requirements were sent. Today we see the church navigating theological conflict.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed the Jerusalem Council. Today we see the second missionary journey launch—and conflict over John Mark.

Paul wanted to revisit churches; Barnabas wanted to bring John Mark (who had deserted them before). "They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company" (Acts 15:39). Even apostles disagreed.

The result: two missionary teams instead of one. God used even their conflict. Today we see that human weakness doesn''t stop God''s work.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw the second journey begin. Today we witness Paul in Philippi—jail becoming gospel opportunity.

Paul and Silas were beaten and imprisoned for freeing a slave girl from a demon. At midnight, they sang hymns. An earthquake opened doors. The jailer nearly killed himself but Paul stopped him.

"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household" (Acts 16:31). The jailer believed and was baptized. Today we see the gospel advancing through suffering.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 witnessed Philippi. Today we see Paul in Athens—engaging culture with gospel truth.

Paul was "greatly distressed" by Athens'' idols. At the Areopagus, he engaged their culture: "I found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you" (Acts 17:23).

Some sneered; some believed. Today we learn to engage culture with wisdom.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 witnessed Athens. Today we see Paul in Corinth—staying longer, establishing church.

Paul stayed 18 months in Corinth, working as tentmaker, preaching in the synagogue, then focusing on Gentiles. The Lord encouraged him in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you" (Acts 18:9-10).

Today we see extended ministry establishing a church that would need Paul''s ongoing attention.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 witnessed Corinth. Today we see the third missionary journey—Ephesus as base.

Paul spent over two years in Ephesus. "All the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord" (Acts 19:10). Ephesus became a hub for regional evangelism.

A riot erupted when the gospel threatened idol-making businesses. Today we see the gospel''s cultural and economic impact.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 witnessed Ephesus. Today we see Paul''s farewell to the Ephesian elders—knowing what awaits.

Paul told the elders: "I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there... I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me" (Acts 20:22-23).

He charged them to shepherd the church and warned of coming wolves. Today we hear a leader''s poignant farewell.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 heard Paul''s farewell. Today we see Paul arrested in Jerusalem—beginning his journey to Rome.

Paul was seized in the temple, falsely accused, arrested by Romans. He addressed the crowd, testified before the Sanhedrin, survived plots, appealed to Caesar. Custody became platform.

"Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome" (Acts 23:11). Today we see God''s plan advancing through arrest.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Acts: Pentecost, church growth, persecution, spread to Gentiles, missionary journeys, Jerusalem Council, and Paul''s arrest and journey to Rome.

"You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8). Acts records this promise being fulfilled.

As you complete this study, how will you be a witness? The Spirit who empowered them empowers us. The story continues through us.'

-- WOMEN OF THE BIBLE 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Ruth''s faith and loyalty. Today we examine Deborah—judge, prophet, and leader.

Deborah judged Israel, settling disputes under her palm tree. When Barak hesitated to fight without her, she accompanied him. Her leadership helped deliver Israel from Canaanite oppression.

"Village life in Israel ceased... until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel" (Judges 5:7). Today we see a woman raised by God to lead His people.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined Deborah. Today we explore Esther—courage for such a time as this.

Esther became queen of Persia without revealing her Jewish identity. When Haman plotted genocide against the Jews, Esther had to choose: remain silent and safe, or speak and risk death.

"If I perish, I perish" (Esther 4:16). She spoke. The plot was exposed. God''s people were saved. Today we see courage that accepted risk.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined Esther. Today we explore Mary, mother of Jesus—favored and faithful.

"Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you" (Luke 1:28). Mary was chosen for the extraordinary role of bearing the Son of God. Her response: "I am the Lord''s servant... May your word to me be fulfilled" (1:38).

Mary pondered mysteries in her heart, watched her son die, and witnessed His resurrection. Today we learn from her faithful surrender.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined Mary. Today we explore Mary Magdalene—delivered and devoted.

Mary Magdalene was freed from seven demons. She followed Jesus, supported His ministry, stood at the cross when others fled, and was first to the empty tomb.

Jesus chose her to be the first witness of His resurrection. "Go to my brothers and tell them" (John 20:17). Today we see devoted discipleship.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Mary Magdalene. Today we explore Martha and Mary of Bethany—different expressions of devotion.

Martha prepared; Mary listened. Jesus commended Mary''s choice. But later, Martha declared: "I believe that you are the Messiah" (John 11:27)—one of the clearest confessions in Scripture.

Both sisters loved Jesus; both are commended. Today we see that different expressions of devotion can both honor Christ.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 examined Martha and Mary. Today we explore Priscilla—partner in ministry.

Priscilla (with Aquila) hosted churches, traveled with Paul, and accurately taught Apollos "the way of God more adequately" (Acts 18:26). She''s often named first—suggesting her prominence.

In a patriarchal culture, Priscilla exercised significant ministry. Today we see partnership in gospel work.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 examined Priscilla. Today we explore the Samaritan woman—transformed and transforming.

Jesus crossed barriers to reach her: geographic (through Samaria), ethnic (Samaritan), gender (talking to a woman), and moral (her five husbands). He offered living water.

She became an evangelist: "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?" (John 4:29). Many believed. Today we see barriers broken.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 examined the Samaritan woman. Today we explore Lydia—first European convert.

Paul went to a place of prayer and found women gathered. Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth, was listening. "The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul''s message" (Acts 16:14).

She was baptized, her household followed, and she hosted the new church. Today we see God opening hearts.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 examined Lydia. Today we explore Phoebe, Junias, and other New Testament women—significant yet often overlooked.

Phoebe was "a deacon of the church" and "benefactor of many" (Romans 16:1-2). Junias was "outstanding among the apostles" (16:7). Mary, Tryphena, Tryphosa, and Persis "worked very hard in the Lord" (16:6, 12).

The early church included prominent women in ministry. Today we honor their contributions.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored remarkable women: Eve, Sarah, Hagar, Ruth, Deborah, Esther, Mary, Mary Magdalene, Martha and Mary, Priscilla, the Samaritan woman, Lydia, and New Testament women.

"There is neither... male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28).

As you complete this study, what has encouraged you? What examples will you follow? God has always worked through faithful women—may their examples inspire your own faithfulness.'

-- HOW WE GOT THE BIBLE 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined canonization. Today we explore transmission—how the Bible was copied and preserved.

Before printing, Scripture was copied by hand. Scribes were meticulous—counting letters, checking margins, using multiple review processes. The Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BC - 70 AD) confirm remarkable accuracy of transmission.

"The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever" (Isaiah 40:8). Today we trace how God''s word was preserved through history.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined transmission. Today we explore translation—making Scripture accessible to all.

Jerome''s Vulgate (Latin), early translations into Syriac, Coptic, and Gothic, and Wycliffe''s English translation all sought to bring Scripture to people in their language.

"Faith comes from hearing the message" (Romans 10:17). Translation enables hearing. Today we appreciate those who made Scripture accessible.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored early translation. Today we examine the Reformation era—Bible translation exploding.

Luther translated the Bible into German. Tyndale died to bring English Scripture. "Lord, open the King of England''s eyes!" Tyndale prayed at his execution. Within years, the English Bible was authorized.

The printing press multiplied Scripture distribution. Today we trace the Reformation''s impact on Bible access.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined Reformation translation. Today we explore the King James Version and its successors.

The 1611 KJV became the dominant English translation for centuries. Its beautiful language shaped English literature and worship. Subsequent translations—RV, ASV, RSV—sought accuracy updates.

"Every word of God is flawless" (Proverbs 30:5). Translation aims to faithfully render flawless words. Today we appreciate the KJV legacy.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored the KJV era. Today we examine modern translations—philosophy and variety.

Translation involves choices: word-for-word (formal equivalence) or thought-for-thought (dynamic equivalence)? NASB emphasizes the former; NIV balances both; NLT emphasizes the latter.

Different translations serve different purposes. Today we understand translation philosophy and choose translations wisely.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored modern translations. Today we address textual criticism—determining the original text.

We have over 5,800 Greek New Testament manuscripts. Variations exist. Textual critics compare manuscripts to determine original readings.

The variations don''t affect any major doctrine. We can trust that we have what the authors wrote. Today we understand the scholarly work behind our Bibles.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored textual criticism. Today we examine archaeology—confirming biblical history.

Archaeological discoveries have repeatedly confirmed Scripture: the Hittites existed (once doubted), Belshazzar ruled (once questioned), and David existed (confirmed by the Tel Dan inscription).

"Your word is truth" (John 17:17). Archaeology doesn''t prove faith but often confirms historical reliability. Today we appreciate archaeological confirmation.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored archaeology. Today we address the Bible''s unity—66 books, one story.

Written by approximately 40 authors over 1,500 years in three languages, the Bible tells one coherent story: creation, fall, redemption, restoration. Human authorship doesn''t explain this unity.

"All Scripture is God-breathed" (2 Timothy 3:16). Divine inspiration produced supernatural unity. Today we marvel at the Bible''s coherence.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored unity. Today we examine the Bible''s power—it changes lives.

Augustine, Luther, Wesley, countless others were transformed by Scripture. The Bible convicts, comforts, guides, and empowers.

"Is not my word like fire... and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?" (Jeremiah 23:29). Today we affirm the Bible''s life-changing power.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored how we got the Bible: inspiration, writing, canonization, transmission, translation, modern versions, textual criticism, archaeology, unity, and power.

"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away" (Matthew 24:35). This book endures.

As you complete this study, has your appreciation for Scripture grown? Will you read it more faithfully? We hold in our hands the preserved, translated, powerful word of the eternal God.'

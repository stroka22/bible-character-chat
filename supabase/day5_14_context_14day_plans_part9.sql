UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored entering the kingdom. Today we examine living in the kingdom—kingdom values and ethics.

The Sermon on the Mount describes kingdom life: blessedness through meekness, mercy, purity. Kingdom citizens are salt and light. They love enemies, don''t retaliate, and trust their Father.

"Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33). Kingdom priority reorders everything else. Today we embrace kingdom values.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored kingdom ethics. Today we examine the kingdom''s growth—parables of expansion.

The kingdom is like a mustard seed: smallest beginning, largest result. Like leaven: permeating everything it touches. Like a treasure or pearl: worth everything to possess.

These parables reveal: the kingdom starts small but grows irresistibly, and it''s worth any sacrifice. Today we see kingdom growth dynamics.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored kingdom parables. Today we examine kingdom community—the church as kingdom expression.

Jesus gave Peter "the keys of the kingdom" (Matthew 16:19). The church isn''t the kingdom but is the primary kingdom community on earth, where King Jesus is acknowledged and obeyed.

Church practices—worship, fellowship, discipline, mission—are kingdom practices. Today we connect church and kingdom.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 connected church and kingdom. Today we examine kingdom power—signs of the King.

Jesus'' miracles weren''t just compassion (though they were) but kingdom signs. When He cast out demons: "If I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matthew 12:28).

Healing, deliverance, provision—all signs that the King has come. Today we see kingdom power breaking through.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored kingdom power. Today we examine kingdom conflict—opposition is expected.

"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence" (Matthew 11:12). The kingdom advances against opposition.

Satan''s kingdom resists. World systems oppose. Our flesh rebels. But the King has already won. Today we expect conflict while trusting victory.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored kingdom conflict. Today we examine already/not yet—the kingdom''s present and future.

The kingdom has come: Jesus reigns now. The kingdom is coming: full manifestation awaits His return. We live in the overlap, experiencing partial fulfillment while awaiting complete fulfillment.

"Your kingdom come" is present reality and future hope. Today we live in the tension.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored already/not yet. Today we examine the kingdom''s consummation—when Christ returns.

"Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power" (1 Corinthians 15:24). Christ''s return brings kingdom completion.

Every knee will bow. Every enemy will be defeated. God will be all in all. Today we anticipate the kingdom''s fullness.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored consummation. Today we examine kingdom mission—we''re sent to proclaim.

"This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come" (Matthew 24:14). Kingdom proclamation is our mission.

We announce that a King has come, a kingdom exists, and citizenship is available through repentance and faith. Today we embrace kingdom mission.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored mission. Today we examine kingdom identity—citizens with responsibilities.

"Our citizenship is in heaven" (Philippians 3:20). Kingdom citizens live under kingdom authority wherever they are. We represent the King.

This means living by kingdom values in a world with different values, extending kingdom grace, and advancing kingdom purposes. Today we live as kingdom citizens.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored God''s kingdom: its nature, Jesus'' proclamation, entering, living, growing, community, power, conflict, timing, consummation, mission, and citizenship.

"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10).

As you complete this study, how will kingdom reality shape your living? The King reigns. Live under His rule.'

-- HOLINESS 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored our positional holiness in Christ. Today we examine progressive holiness—growing in Christlikeness.

Positional holiness is instant at conversion; progressive holiness takes a lifetime. "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2). Transformation is process.

This involves Spirit''s power, Scripture''s truth, community''s support, and our cooperation. Today we commit to the growth process.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored progressive holiness. Today we examine holiness in thought life—where battles are won or lost.

"Take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5). Thoughts precede actions. Mental purity produces behavioral purity.

What do you dwell on? What enters your mind through media, conversation, imagination? Today we address thought-life holiness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed thoughts. Today we examine holiness in speech—words matter.

"The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body" (James 3:6). Words bless or curse, build or destroy, heal or wound.

"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths" (Ephesians 4:29). Holy people speak holy words. Today we pursue holiness in speech.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed speech. Today we examine holiness in relationships—with family, friends, and enemies.

"Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy" (Hebrews 12:14). Holiness isn''t monastic isolation but transformed relating.

Holiness in relationships means: truthfulness, forgiveness, patience, serving, and loving even difficult people. Today we pursue relational holiness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed relationships. Today we examine holiness in work—Monday through Friday matters.

"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord" (Colossians 3:23). Holy work means: excellence, integrity, servant-heartedness, and witness.

Your workplace is your primary mission field. Holiness there displays kingdom reality. Today we pursue vocational holiness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 addressed work. Today we examine holiness in sexuality—counter-cultural purity.

"It is God''s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality" (1 Thessalonians 4:3). Sexual holiness is explicitly mentioned because it''s explicitly challenged.

In a sexually saturated culture, purity requires intentionality. Boundaries matter. Accountability helps. Today we pursue sexual holiness.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed sexuality. Today we examine holiness in money—stewardship over accumulation.

"No one can serve two masters... You cannot serve both God and money" (Matthew 6:24). Money easily becomes idol. Holy money management treats it as tool, not goal.

Contentment, generosity, and trust characterize financial holiness. Today we pursue holiness with money.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed money. Today we examine hindrances to holiness—what blocks our growth.

Hindrances include: unconfessed sin, unforgiveness, worldly input, bad company, spiritual neglect, and unbelief that change is possible.

"Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles" (Hebrews 12:1). Today we identify and address hindrances.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 identified hindrances. Today we examine helps to holiness—practices that promote growth.

Helps include: Scripture saturation, consistent prayer, Spirit-reliance, accountability, worship, fasting, service, and suffering rightly received.

"Train yourself to be godly" (1 Timothy 4:7). Training requires discipline. Today we employ means of grace.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored holiness: God''s holiness, our calling, positional and progressive holiness, thought life, speech, relationships, work, sexuality, money, hindrances, and helps.

"Just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do" (1 Peter 1:15).

As you complete this study, where do you most need to grow? Holiness is both gift and pursuit. Press on.'

-- PRAY LIKE JESUS 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Jesus praying in crisis. Today we examine His prayer rhythm—regular withdrawal for prayer.

"Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed" (Mark 1:35). This wasn''t exception but pattern.

Jesus was busy, in demand, effective—yet He prioritized prayer. If He needed it, how much more do we? Today we establish prayer rhythm.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored Jesus'' prayer rhythm. Today we examine His prayer locations—mountain, garden, wilderness.

Jesus prayed on mountains (Luke 6:12), in the wilderness (Luke 5:16), in gardens (Luke 22:41), in crowds (Matthew 14:23). Location varied; prayer happened.

The point isn''t specific place but intentional seeking. Today we find our places to pray.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored prayer locations. Today we examine Jesus'' prayer posture—He modeled various postures.

Jesus looked up to heaven (John 17:1), fell on His face (Matthew 26:39), knelt (Luke 22:41). He prayed standing in public, prostrate in anguish.

Posture isn''t magic but can express heart. Today we consider how physical posture serves prayer.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed prayer posture. Today we explore Jesus teaching on persistence—keep asking.

"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened" (Matthew 7:7). All three verbs suggest continuous action: keep asking, keep seeking, keep knocking.

The parable of the persistent widow reinforces: "always pray and not give up" (Luke 18:1). Today we persist in prayer.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored persistence. Today we examine Jesus teaching on faith—believing prayer.

"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ''Go, throw yourself into the sea,'' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them" (Mark 11:23).

Faith isn''t magic formula but trust in a good Father. Today we pray with faith.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored faith. Today we examine Jesus teaching on forgiveness in prayer—unforgiveness blocks.

"When you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins" (Mark 11:25).

Unforgiveness toward others hinders prayer. Forgiveness releases us to receive. Today we forgive so we can pray freely.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed forgiveness. Today we examine Jesus'' high priestly prayer—John 17.

Jesus prayed for Himself (glorification), for His disciples (protection, sanctification), and for all believers (unity, witness). The entire chapter is prayer.

This is the longest recorded prayer of Jesus—a window into His heart. Today we meditate on John 17.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored John 17. Today we examine Jesus praying for others—intercession.

Jesus prayed for Peter specifically: "Simon, I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail" (Luke 22:32). He intercedes for us still (Hebrews 7:25).

Praying for others is Christ-like prayer. Today we follow Jesus'' intercessory example.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored intercession. Today we examine Jesus praying for enemies—radical prayer.

"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). Even while being crucified, Jesus prayed for His crucifiers.

"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44). Today we pray for enemies.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored Jesus'' prayer life: His model prayer, solitary prayer, crisis prayer, rhythm, locations, posture, persistence, faith, forgiveness, high priestly prayer, intercession, and praying for enemies.

"One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, ''Lord, teach us to pray''" (Luke 11:1).

As you complete this study, how will you pray differently? Jesus modeled prayer. Follow Him.'

-- RENEWING YOUR MIND 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored putting off old patterns. Today we examine putting on new patterns—replacement is key.

You can''t just stop thinking wrongly; you must start thinking rightly. "Put off your old self... and... put on the new self" (Ephesians 4:22-24). The metaphor is clothing: take off, put on.

What will replace the lies you''ve believed? Today we identify replacement truths.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored replacement. Today we examine the role of Scripture—renewing happens through truth.

"Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth" (John 17:17). Scripture is primary truth source. Mind renewal happens through Scripture saturation.

Reading, meditating, memorizing, studying—all bring Scripture into the mind''s renewal process. Today we commit to Scripture saturation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored Scripture''s role. Today we examine meditation—not just reading but dwelling.

"Blessed is the one... whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night" (Psalm 1:1-2). Meditation is slow, repeated, thoughtful engagement with truth.

Joshua was told to meditate day and night for success (Joshua 1:8). Today we practice biblical meditation.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored meditation. Today we examine memorization—truth available anytime.

"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11). Memorized Scripture is available when books aren''t—in temptation, crisis, opportunity.

Memorization takes effort but pays dividends. Today we begin or continue memorizing.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored memorization. Today we address lies we believe—identifying false thinking.

Common lies: "I''m worthless." "God is disappointed in me." "I can never change." "I need others'' approval." "My past defines me."

Identify lies by examining recurring struggles, emotional reactions, and internal self-talk. Today we identify our specific lies.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 identified lies. Today we replace lies with truth—specific counters.

For "I''m worthless": "I am God''s workmanship" (Ephesians 2:10). For "God is disappointed": "There is no condemnation" (Romans 8:1). For "I can never change": "I am a new creation" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

Specific lies need specific truth. Today we pair lies with countering Scripture.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 paired lies with truth. Today we examine thoughts and emotions—they''re connected.

Wrong thinking produces wrong feeling. Depressed thoughts produce depressed moods. Anxious thoughts produce anxious feelings.

Changing thoughts changes emotions—not instantly, but really. "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2). Today we see the thought-emotion connection.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 connected thoughts and emotions. Today we explore the Spirit''s role—renewal isn''t self-help.

"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind" (Ephesians 4:23). The Holy Spirit renews. We cooperate, but He transforms.

Rely on the Spirit, not willpower alone. Today we invite Spirit-empowered renewal.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored the Spirit''s role. Today we address setbacks—old patterns return.

Renewal isn''t instant or linear. Old thoughts resurface. Patterns reassert themselves. What then?

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us" (1 John 1:9). Setbacks are not disqualification. Get back up. Today we handle setbacks with grace.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored mind renewal: the command, how minds work, putting off and on, Scripture''s role, meditation, memorization, lies, truth, emotions, the Spirit, and setbacks.

"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2).

As you complete this study, what lies need replacing? What truth will you hide in your heart? Transformation is possible. Renew your mind.'

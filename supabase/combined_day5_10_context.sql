SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the meek inheriting the earth. Today we examine the fourth beatitude: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled" (Matthew 5:6).

Hunger and thirst are survival drives—you can''t ignore them. Jesus describes people who crave righteousness with that intensity. This isn''t casual interest but consuming desire. "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God" (Psalm 42:1).

The promise: they will be filled. Not "might be" but "will be." God satisfies those who genuinely seek Him. "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart" (Jeremiah 29:13). Today we examine our spiritual appetite: Do we hunger for God, or are we spiritually snacking?'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day6_context = 'Day 5 examined hungering for righteousness. Today we explore the fifth beatitude: "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy" (Matthew 5:7).

Mercy is compassion in action—seeing need and responding with help rather than judgment. It reflects God''s own character: "The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love" (Psalm 145:8).

Note the reciprocal pattern: the merciful receive mercy. This echoes the Lord''s Prayer: "Forgive us as we forgive." James warns: "Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!" (James 2:13). Today we examine our mercy quotient: How do we respond to those who don''t deserve compassion?'

-- Day 7
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day7_context = 'Day 6 explored showing mercy. Today we examine the sixth beatitude: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God" (Matthew 5:8).

Purity of heart isn''t sinlessness but singleness—an undivided heart wholly devoted to God. "Create in me a pure heart, O God" (Psalm 51:10). The impure heart serves multiple masters; the pure heart serves One.

The reward is staggering: seeing God. "Now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Purity of heart positions us for the ultimate blessing—beholding God Himself. Today we ask: What divides my heart? What competes for my singular devotion to God?'
WHERE slug = 'beatitudes-9-days';

-- Day 8
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day8_context = 'Day 7 explored purity of heart. Today we examine the seventh beatitude: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9).

Peacemaking isn''t passivity or conflict avoidance. It''s actively pursuing reconciliation—between people and God, and between people and people. Jesus is the ultimate peacemaker: "He himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier" (Ephesians 2:14).

Peacemakers are called "children of God" because they share the family trait. God made peace through the cross; His children extend that peace. Today we examine: Where might God be calling you to make peace? What reconciliation have you avoided?'
WHERE slug = 'beatitudes-9-days';

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day9_context = 'We''ve journeyed through seven beatitudes. Today we reach the final two: persecution for righteousness and for Christ''s sake.

"Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness... Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven" (Matthew 5:10-12).

Persecution marks authentic discipleship. "Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted" (2 Timothy 3:12). The world crucified Jesus; His followers shouldn''t expect better treatment. Yet the reward is great—heaven''s honor for earth''s rejection.

-- ============================================

-- Day 5
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored peace. Today we examine the fourth fruit: patience—longsuffering in the face of provocation.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... patience" (Galatians 5:22). The Greek word "makrothumia" literally means "long-tempered"—the opposite of short-tempered. It''s slow anger, extended tolerance, enduring provocation without retaliation.

God Himself models patience: "The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love" (Psalm 103:8). We''ve all tested His patience; now we extend patience to others. Today we examine specific relationships or situations that require supernatural patience—and ask the Spirit to produce it.'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 6
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day6_context = 'Day 5 explored patience. Today we examine two related fruits: kindness and goodness.

Kindness is gentle benevolence toward others—a disposition of warmth and generosity. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you" (Ephesians 4:32). Kindness was demonstrated supremely in Christ''s treatment of sinners.

Goodness goes further—it''s active benevolence, doing good even when kindness isn''t returned. "Let us not become weary in doing good" (Galatians 6:9). Today we look for opportunities to be kind and do good, especially to those who can''t repay us.'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 7
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day7_context = 'Day 6 explored kindness and goodness. Today we examine faithfulness—reliable trustworthiness over time.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... faithfulness" (Galatians 5:22). This is dependability—being the person others can count on. "A faithful person who can find?" (Proverbs 20:6). Faithfulness is rare and precious.

God''s faithfulness is our model: "Because of the LORD''s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness" (Lamentations 3:22-23). The Spirit produces in us the same reliability. Today we examine our commitments: Are we faithful in big things and small?'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 8
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day8_context = 'Day 7 explored faithfulness. Today we examine gentleness—meekness, strength under control.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... gentleness" (Galatians 5:23). This isn''t weakness but power restrained. A gentle person could react harshly but chooses not to. Jesus described Himself as "gentle and humble in heart" (Matthew 11:29)—yet He drove out moneychangers with a whip.

Gentleness especially shows when we''re wronged or when correcting others. "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently" (Galatians 6:1). Today we examine our responses: Do we react or respond? Do we crush or restore?'
WHERE slug = 'fruit-of-spirit-9';

-- Day 9
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day9_context = 'We''ve journeyed through eight fruits. Today we reach the final one: self-control—mastery over impulses.

"The fruit of the Spirit is... self-control" (Galatians 5:23). This governs appetites, emotions, and desires. The undisciplined person is "like a city whose walls are broken through" (Proverbs 25:28)—vulnerable to every attack.

Paul concluded: "Against such things there is no law" (Galatians 5:23). You''ll never be arrested for too much love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, or self-control! These fruits fulfill what law demanded but couldn''t produce. As you complete this study, which fruits need most cultivation? Ask the Spirit to grow them in you.'

-- ============================================

-- FORGIVENESS 10 DAYS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored forgiving yourself. Today we examine what forgiveness is NOT—clearing up common misconceptions.

Forgiveness is NOT: forgetting (we may always remember); condoning (we don''t approve the wrong); excusing (we don''t minimize the offense); reconciliation (which requires two parties); removing consequences (legal or natural results may remain); or trusting again (trust must be earned).

Understanding what forgiveness isn''t helps us embrace what it is: a decision to release the debt, trusting God for justice, and refusing to let bitterness control us. Today we clarify our understanding and remove false barriers to forgiveness.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 clarified what forgiveness is not. Today we explore the cost of unforgiveness—what happens when we refuse to forgive.

Unforgiveness is a prison we build for ourselves. "See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many" (Hebrews 12:15). Bitterness spreads and contaminates.

Physically, unforgiveness produces stress hormones and health problems. Relationally, it poisons other connections. Spiritually, it hinders prayer and blocks God''s forgiveness of us (Matthew 6:15). Today we count the cost and ask: Is holding onto this offense worth what it''s costing me?',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined unforgiveness''s cost. Today we look at radical forgiveness—forgiving the unforgivable.

Some offenses seem beyond forgiveness: abuse, betrayal, violence against loved ones. Yet Jesus forgave His executioners from the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). Stephen, being stoned, echoed: "Lord, do not hold this sin against them" (Acts 7:60).

Such forgiveness is humanly impossible. It requires supernatural grace. We can''t manufacture it; we can only receive it from God and extend it to others. Today we face our hardest cases, acknowledging our inability and asking for divine enabling.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 tackled radical forgiveness. Today we explore ongoing forgiveness—what to do when the same person offends repeatedly.

Peter asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?" Jesus answered, "Not seven times, but seventy-seven times" (Matthew 18:21-22). Not a literal count but unlimited forgiveness.

This doesn''t mean tolerating ongoing abuse without boundaries. It means our disposition remains forgiving rather than vengeful. We can forgive while also protecting ourselves from continued harm. Today we navigate the balance between repeated forgiveness and wise boundaries.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed repeated forgiveness. Today we examine seeking forgiveness—what to do when we''re the offender.

"If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there... First go and be reconciled" (Matthew 5:23-24). Seeking forgiveness is as important as granting it.

A genuine apology includes: acknowledging specific wrong, accepting responsibility (no "but..."), expressing sorrow for the impact, asking for forgiveness, and committing to change. "I''m sorry you feel that way" isn''t an apology. Today we consider who we might need to approach.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored forgiveness from every angle. Today we commit to a lifestyle of forgiveness.

"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you" (Ephesians 4:32). The measure of our forgiveness is Christ''s forgiveness of us—unlimited.

As you complete this study, take inventory: Is there anyone you need to forgive? Anyone whose forgiveness you need to seek? Any bitterness taking root? Forgiveness isn''t a one-time event but a way of life for those who''ve been forgiven much. Walk in freedom—the freedom Christ died to give.'
WHERE slug = 'forgiveness-10-days';

-- HOPE IN HARD TIMES 10 DAYS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined hope anchored in promises. Today we explore hope''s expression: how to maintain hope practically when circumstances are crushing.

Hope expresses itself through: prayer (taking burdens to God), community (receiving encouragement from others), worship (reminding ourselves of God''s character), Scripture (meditating on truth), and perseverance (continuing faithful action despite feelings).

Paul described his experience: "We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed" (2 Corinthians 4:8-9). The difference between "pressed" and "crushed" is hope. Today we practice hope''s practical expressions.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored hope''s practical expressions. Today we examine a specific source: testimonies of God''s faithfulness—past evidences that sustain present hope.

"I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago" (Psalm 77:11). When present circumstances seem hopeless, remembering past faithfulness sustains us.

Keep a record of God''s faithfulness: answered prayers, unexpected provisions, guidance in decisions, comfort in grief. In dark times, review this record. What God has done, He can do again. "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8). Today we build our own monument of remembrance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 emphasized remembering God''s faithfulness. Today we explore hope for others—how to give hope to those who are struggling.

"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ... who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). Our suffering equips us to comfort others.

Hope-giving involves: presence (being with), listening (not rushing to fix), empathy (feeling with), encouragement (speaking truth gently), and patience (allowing time). Today we consider who in our lives needs the hope we''ve received.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored giving hope to others. Today we examine hope''s ultimate ground: the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3). Hope is living because Christ is living.

If Jesus rose, death is defeated, sin is paid for, and God''s promises are certain. The resurrection validates everything Christ claimed and everything Scripture promises. Today we anchor our hope in resurrection reality—the historical event that guarantees our future.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 grounded hope in resurrection. Today we look forward: hope for Christ''s return and the restoration of all things.

"But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ" (Philippians 3:20). Christian hope isn''t wishful thinking but confident expectation based on promise.

Christ will return, bodies will be raised, creation will be renewed, and all wrongs will be made right. "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain" (Revelation 21:4). Today we lift our eyes to ultimate hope.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored hope from every angle: its foundation, expression, testimonies, sharing, resurrection ground, and ultimate fulfillment. Today we commit to living as hope-filled people.

"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure" (Hebrews 6:19). Hope anchors us when storms rage. It''s not denial of difficulty but confidence despite difficulty.

As you complete this study, what hope truths will you carry forward? What practices will sustain your hope? Who needs the hope you''ve received? Live as people of hope—resurrection people who know how the story ends.'

-- WORK AND CALLING 10 DAYS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored work-life balance. Today we examine a common struggle: dealing with difficult colleagues and bosses.

"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ" (Ephesians 6:5). Paul''s instructions to slaves apply to employees: respect authority, work sincerely, serve as unto Christ—even when bosses are difficult.

This doesn''t mean tolerating abuse, but it does mean maintaining integrity regardless of others'' behavior. "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (Romans 12:21). Today we consider how to honor Christ when workplace relationships are challenging.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed difficult colleagues. Today we explore ambition: is it godly or worldly?

Scripture doesn''t condemn ambition but channels it. "Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands" (1 Thessalonians 4:11). Ambition for godly character and faithful service is commendable; ambition for self-advancement at others'' expense is worldly.

The test: Are you serving or climbing? Are you contributing or competing? Is God glorified or self exalted? Godly ambition seeks excellence for God''s glory, not personal empire-building. Today we examine our motives.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined ambition. Today we explore the workplace as mission field—your colleagues are your congregation.

"You are the light of the world... let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:14, 16). Your workplace is where you shine. Colleagues observe your integrity, attitude, and response to pressure.

Workplace witness involves: excellence that draws questions, character that stands out, compassion for struggling coworkers, and readiness to explain your hope when asked (1 Peter 3:15). Today we view our workplace as ministry assignment.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored workplace witness. Today we address success and failure: how do we handle both in godly ways?

In success: "Remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth" (Deuteronomy 8:18). Success is stewarded, not celebrated selfishly. Give God glory; share with others; remain humble.

In failure: "Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again" (Proverbs 24:16). Failure isn''t final. Learn what you can, accept responsibility, make amends if needed, and move forward. Neither success nor failure defines you—Christ does. Today we prepare for both.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed success and failure. Today we explore transitions: when God calls you to something new.

Sometimes God moves us: new jobs, new cities, new seasons. "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5-6).

Transitions require: discerning God''s leading (through prayer, Scripture, counsel, circumstances), trusting His timing (not rushing or resisting), and faithful finishing (leaving well, not just leaving). Today we consider whether God might be preparing a transition—or calling us to stay faithfully.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored work as calling, vocation, excellence, relationships, witness, ambition, handling results, and transitions. Today we commit to working for God''s glory.

"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters" (Colossians 3:23). Your work matters to God—not just your "ministry work" but all your work.

As you complete this study, how will you approach Monday differently? What changes will you make? How will you view your workplace as calling? Work isn''t a necessary evil but a divine assignment. Do it heartily, as for the Lord.'

-- FINANCIAL WISDOM 10 DAYS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined debt. Today we explore saving and planning—wisdom for the future without anxiety about it.

"The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down" (Proverbs 21:20). Wise people save; fools consume everything. Yet Jesus warned against storing up treasures on earth obsessively. What''s the balance?

Save wisely but hold loosely. Plan prudently but trust ultimately. Emergency funds, retirement provisions, and children''s education are wise—if not at the expense of generosity or at the cost of anxiety. "Do not worry about tomorrow" (Matthew 6:34) doesn''t mean don''t plan; it means don''t fret. Today we pursue wise planning with peaceful trust.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed saving and planning. Today we examine a crucial attitude: gratitude—the antidote to financial worry.

"Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God''s will for you in Christ Jesus" (1 Thessalonians 5:18). Gratitude shifts focus from what we lack to what we have. It recognizes every good gift as from God (James 1:17).

Grateful people are generous people—they recognize abundance even when accounts show scarcity. Ungrateful people hoard even when blessed with plenty. Gratitude enables contentment, fuels generosity, and defeats anxiety. Today we cultivate thanksgiving as a financial discipline.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 emphasized gratitude. Today we explore teaching the next generation—passing financial wisdom to children.

"Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it" (Proverbs 22:6). Financial discipleship begins young: giving, saving, spending wisely, working hard, and trusting God.

Practical steps: give children opportunities to earn, teach giving before spending, allow age-appropriate financial decisions (and consequences), model generosity and contentment, and discuss money openly (not as taboo). Today we consider what financial legacy we''re building for the next generation.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed teaching children. Today we examine trusting God when finances are tight—practical faith in scarcity.

"I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread" (Psalm 37:25). God provides for His people—sometimes miraculously, often through ordinary means like work and community.

Tight times test our theology: Do we really believe God provides? Practical steps: seek additional income if possible, cut expenses ruthlessly, accept help from church family without shame, and maintain generosity even in scarcity (the widow''s mite principle). Today we trust God practically.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed financial scarcity. Today we explore financial decision-making—how to make wise money choices.

Wise decisions consider: Is it within my means (don''t spend what you don''t have)? Have I prayed about it (invited God into the decision)? Have I sought counsel (Proverbs 15:22)? Does it align with values (or just wants)? What''s the opportunity cost (what else could this money accomplish)?

Major purchases deserve major reflection. Impulse buying is usually unwise buying. "Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise" (Ephesians 5:15). Today we develop a framework for financial decisions.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored stewardship, generosity, contentment, debt, saving, gratitude, teaching children, trusting in scarcity, and decision-making. Today we commit to financial faithfulness.

"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much" (Luke 16:10). Financial faithfulness in small things prepares us for larger stewardship. God entrusts resources to trustworthy managers.

As you complete this study, what financial changes will you make? What habits need forming or breaking? How will you hold money loosely while managing it wisely? Financial freedom isn''t about amount but attitude—trusting God and serving His purposes with whatever He provides.'

-- TEN COMMANDMENTS 10 DAYS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined the third commandment (misusing God''s name). Today we explore the fourth: "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy" (Exodus 20:8).

God commanded rest—one day in seven set apart from labor. He modeled it Himself in creation, not because He was tired but to establish the pattern. The Sabbath was gift before it was command: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" (Mark 2:27).

Christians debate Sabbath application today. Some observe Saturday, some Sunday, some a different day. What''s not debatable: we need rhythms of rest and worship. God designed us for work-rest cycles. Today we examine our rhythms: Are we resting, or are we running ourselves ragged?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined Sabbath rest. Today we explore the fifth commandment: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12).

This is the first commandment with a promise: "so that you may live long in the land." Society''s health depends on healthy families; families depend on honoring parents. This doesn''t mean agreeing with everything they do but treating them with respect and care.

For children: obedience. For adults: honor even when obedience no longer applies. For aging parents: care provision. "If anyone does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, they have denied the faith" (1 Timothy 5:8). Today we examine how we honor our parents.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined honoring parents. Today we explore the sixth commandment: "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13).

This prohibits unlawful killing of another person—not capital punishment (prescribed in the same law) or just war, but murder from hatred. Jesus deepened it: "Anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment" (Matthew 5:22). The murderous act begins with murderous heart.

We may not kill, but do we hate? Do we assassinate character if not body? Do we harbor anger that, given opportunity, would destroy? Today we examine our hearts for any deadly attitudes.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined murder (and anger). Today we explore the seventh commandment: "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14).

Marriage is a covenant—a binding promise. Adultery breaks that covenant, violating trust and causing incalculable damage to spouses, children, and communities. "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure" (Hebrews 13:4).

Jesus deepened it: "Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matthew 5:28). Sexual faithfulness begins in the mind. Today we guard our hearts and honor marriage—our own or the institution itself.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined adultery. Today we explore commandments eight and nine: "You shall not steal" and "You shall not give false testimony" (Exodus 20:15-16).

Stealing takes what isn''t ours—obviously through theft, but also through unfair wages, fraud, cheating, and dishonest business practices. The positive command: "Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful" (Ephesians 4:28).

False testimony includes lying in court but extends to all deceit. "Do not lie to each other" (Colossians 3:9). Truth-telling is foundational to trust, and trust is foundational to society. Today we examine our honesty in possessions and words.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored nine commandments. Today we reach the tenth: "You shall not covet" (Exodus 20:17).

This commandment goes entirely internal—coveting is desiring what belongs to another. You can keep the other nine externally while breaking this one constantly. It addresses the root from which other sins grow: desire for what isn''t ours.

Covetousness is behind theft, adultery, lying, and even murder (James 4:2). The antidote is contentment: "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances" (Philippians 4:11). As you complete this study, how will the Ten Commandments shape your life? They reveal God''s character and our need for grace.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined propitiation—satisfying God''s wrath. Today we explore another dimension: redemption—being bought back from slavery.

"You were bought at a price" (1 Corinthians 6:20). The marketplace image: we were slaves to sin, owned by another. Christ paid the ransom. "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45).

What was the price? "You were redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect" (1 Peter 1:18-19). His life for ours. We belong to Him now because He paid for us. Today we marvel at redemption''s cost.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined redemption. Today we explore reconciliation—enemies becoming friends through Christ''s death.

"While we were God''s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son" (Romans 5:10). Sin made us enemies of God—not just lawbreakers but active rebels. Reconciliation restored the relationship.

Christ is "our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility" (Ephesians 2:14). Both vertical reconciliation (with God) and horizontal reconciliation (with others) flow from the cross. Today we receive the ministry of reconciliation and become its ambassadors.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined reconciliation. Today we explore substitution—Christ dying in our place.

"He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24). "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us" (2 Corinthians 5:21). The sinless One became sin; the guiltless bore guilt; the eternal One died—so that we might live.

Substitutionary atonement is Christianity''s heart. Without it, we bear our own sins and face our own judgment. With it, Christ bore what we deserved, and we receive what He earned. Today we rest in the exchange: His righteousness for our sin.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined substitution. Today we explore the extent: for whom did Christ die?

"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world" (1 John 2:2). Christ''s death is sufficient for all, efficient for those who believe. The offer is universal; the reception is by faith.

This means no one is beyond hope. The worst sinner can be saved. The gospel is for "whoever believes" (John 3:16). Today we celebrate the breadth of Christ''s provision while recognizing that receiving its benefits requires personal faith.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Christ''s death''s extent. Today we explore its results: what did the cross accomplish for believers?

The cross accomplished: forgiveness of sins (Colossians 2:13), justification—declared righteous (Romans 5:1), adoption as children (Galatians 4:5), freedom from sin''s slavery (Romans 6:18), victory over Satan (Colossians 2:15), and guaranteed glorification (Romans 8:30).

These are not future possibilities but present possessions. What Christ accomplished, we receive by faith. Today we inventory our riches in Christ—every spiritual blessing secured at Calvary.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored why Jesus had to die: sacrifice, propitiation, redemption, reconciliation, substitution, and results. Today we respond with gratitude and surrender.

"The love of Christ compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again" (2 Corinthians 5:14-15).

The cross demands response. How can we receive such love and live unchanged? As you complete this study, let the cross compel you to live no longer for yourself but for Him who died for you.'

From murder (Cain and Abel) to corruption (before the flood) to pride (Tower of Babel), sin metastasized rapidly. "The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become" (Genesis 6:5). What Adam and Eve began, their descendants accelerated.

Yet grace kept appearing: God protected Cain, saved Noah''s family, and confused languages rather than destroying Babel. Judgment was always tempered with mercy. Today we see the pattern: sin spreads, but grace pursues.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 traced sin''s spread. Today we witness a crucial turning point: God''s call of Abram—the beginning of redemption''s plan.

"The LORD had said to Abram, ''Go from your country... to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you... and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you''" (Genesis 12:1-3).

From one man, God would build a nation. Through that nation, blessing would reach all nations. The promise to Abraham is the gospel in seed form—Galatians 3:8 calls it "the gospel in advance." Today we see redemption''s plan beginning to unfold.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed Abram''s call. Today we examine the covenant God made with him—unconditional promises that anchor all future redemption.

In Genesis 15, God formalized His promise in a covenant ceremony. Abram cut animals in half; normally both parties would walk between the pieces, taking the curse on themselves if they broke covenant. But only God (as a smoking fire pot and blazing torch) passed through.

This was unconditional promise: God obligated Himself without requiring Abram''s performance. The covenant would stand regardless of human faithfulness—because it depended on God''s faithfulness alone. Today we rest in covenant grace.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined the Abrahamic covenant. Today we trace the promise through Isaac and Jacob—the patriarchs who carried it forward.

God promised Abraham a son through Sarah, despite their advanced age. Isaac was born miraculously. Isaac''s son Jacob (later Israel) became father of twelve sons—the tribes of Israel. Through them, Abraham''s descendants would become a nation.

The promise traveled through chosen individuals: "Not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring" (Romans 9:7). God selected Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. Today we see God sovereignly guiding His redemptive plan through generations.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 traced the promise through Isaac and Jacob. Today we meet Joseph—the one who preserved the promise-bearers in Egypt.

Joseph''s story is a miniature gospel: betrayed by brothers, sold for silver, falsely accused, seemingly forgotten, then exalted to save those who betrayed him. "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (Genesis 50:20).

Joseph preserved Israel in Egypt, setting up the Exodus—the defining redemption event until the cross. Today we see God working even through betrayal and suffering to accomplish His purposes.',
day10_context = 'We''ve journeyed from creation through fall to promise—and traced that promise through Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Today we look forward to fulfillment.

Everything in Genesis points ahead: the serpent-crusher (3:15), Abraham''s blessing to all nations (12:3), and the scepter from Judah (49:10). The Old Testament is a story looking for an ending—a problem awaiting a solution.

That solution is Jesus: the woman''s seed who crushed Satan, Abraham''s offspring through whom nations are blessed, the Lion of Judah who reigns forever. As you complete this study, see how the story you''ve traced finds its fulfillment in Christ.'

"In the beginning God [Elohim—plural form] created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). "Let us make mankind in our image" (Genesis 1:26). "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4)—yet the word "one" (echad) can mean unified plurality (as in Genesis 2:24).

The Old Testament also distinguishes between the LORD and His Angel, His Spirit, and His Wisdom (Proverbs 8). These hints prepared for the New Testament''s full revelation of three Persons in one God. Today we trace these early indicators.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined Old Testament hints. Today we explore the Trinity in the New Testament—full revelation of three Persons.

At Jesus'' baptism: "Heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ''This is my Son''" (Matthew 3:16-17). Father speaking, Son being baptized, Spirit descending—three distinct Persons acting simultaneously.

The Great Commission: "baptizing them in the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19). One name, three Persons. Today we see the New Testament''s explicit Trinitarian revelation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined New Testament revelation. Today we explore each Person''s distinct role in salvation.

The Father plans salvation: "He chose us in him before the creation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4). The Son accomplishes salvation: "We have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (Hebrews 10:10). The Spirit applies salvation: "He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit" (Titus 3:5).

All three work together in our salvation. To lose any Person is to lose salvation''s completeness. Today we appreciate each Person''s contribution.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined salvation roles. Today we explore Trinitarian prayer: how do we address the three-in-one God?

We pray to the Father: "Our Father in heaven" (Matthew 6:9). We pray through the Son: "I will do whatever you ask in my name" (John 14:13). We pray by the Spirit: "The Spirit helps us in our weakness... intercedes for us" (Romans 8:26).

All three are involved in prayer. We approach the Father, through the Son, empowered by the Spirit. Trinitarian prayer isn''t a formula but relationship with the full Godhead. Today we practice praying with Trinitarian awareness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Trinitarian prayer. Today we address common errors: what the Trinity is NOT.

Modalism says God is one Person who appears in three modes—like an actor playing three roles. But Father, Son, and Spirit interact simultaneously (Jesus'' baptism proves this wrong).

Tritheism says there are three gods. But "the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4).

Arianism says the Son and Spirit are created beings, less than the Father. But "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1).

Today we avoid these errors while humbly acknowledging mystery beyond full comprehension.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored the Trinity''s meaning, Old Testament hints, New Testament revelation, salvation roles, prayer implications, and common errors. Today we worship the Triune God.

"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Corinthians 13:14). Paul''s benediction captures Trinitarian blessing.

The Trinity isn''t abstract doctrine but living relationship. We know the Father''s love, experience the Son''s grace, and enjoy the Spirit''s fellowship. As you complete this study, let knowledge lead to worship of the God who is forever one and forever three.'

-- WHAT IS SALVATION
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined salvation''s solution: grace through faith. Today we explore justification more deeply—how God declares sinners righteous.

"God... justifies the ungodly" (Romans 4:5). This is stunning: God doesn''t justify the righteous but the ungodly! Justification isn''t God recognizing our goodness but declaring us righteous based on Christ''s righteousness credited to us.

Justification is forensic—a legal declaration. "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1). The verdict is in; the case is closed. Today we rest in the reality that our standing before God is settled—not by our performance but by Christ''s.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored justification. Today we examine sanctification—the process of becoming what we''ve been declared.

Justification is instantaneous; sanctification is progressive. "He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion" (Philippians 1:6). We''re being transformed into Christ''s image "with ever-increasing glory" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

Sanctification involves our effort: "Work out your salvation" (Philippians 2:12). But it depends on God''s power: "for it is God who works in you" (2:13). We work because He works. Today we embrace the ongoing process of becoming holy.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined sanctification. Today we look forward: glorification—salvation''s completion when Christ returns.

"We know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:2). Glorification completes what justification declared and sanctification developed. We will be fully conformed to Christ''s image.

"The creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God" (Romans 8:21). Not just our bodies but all creation will be renewed. Today we anticipate salvation''s glorious conclusion.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 anticipated glorification. Today we examine assurance: how can we know we''re saved?

"I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life" (1 John 5:13). Assurance is possible—and important.

Assurance rests on: God''s promises (what He said), the Spirit''s witness (internal confirmation), and changed lives (evidence of new birth). Doubts may come, but we return to these foundations. Today we strengthen our assurance on biblical grounds.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined assurance. Today we explore salvation''s security: can we lose it?

Jesus said: "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand" (John 10:28). Strong words! Yet warnings exist about falling away.

How do we reconcile these? Those truly saved will persevere—not perfectly but ultimately. Apparent "loss" of salvation reveals it was never genuinely possessed: "They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us" (1 John 2:19). Today we find security in God''s keeping power while taking warnings seriously.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored salvation''s need (sin), solution (grace), declaration (justification), process (sanctification), completion (glorification), assurance, and security. Today we respond with worship.

Salvation is all of God—from start to finish. "From him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever!" (Romans 11:36). We contribute nothing but our need; He provides everything.

As you complete this study, marvel at salvation''s scope. You were dead; now alive. Condemned; now acquitted. Enslaved; now free. Lost; now found. Let gratitude overflow in worship and service to the God who saved you.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined repentance. Today we explore confession—the specific acknowledgment that leads to cleansing.

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). Confession means agreeing with God about our sin—calling it what He calls it, without excuse or minimization.

Confession is specific, not vague: "I sinned by lying about X" rather than "I''m not perfect." It takes responsibility: "I did this" rather than "mistakes were made." And it trusts God''s promise: He is faithful to forgive. Today we practice honest confession.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined confession. Today we explore redemption—God''s act of buying us back from slavery.

"You were bought at a price" (1 Corinthians 6:20). Redemption is marketplace language: a slave is purchased and set free. We were "slaves to sin" (Romans 6:17); Christ paid our ransom; now we''re "slaves to righteousness" (6:18).

The price was staggering: "not with perishable things such as silver or gold... but with the precious blood of Christ" (1 Peter 1:18-19). We belong to Him because He paid for us. Today we reflect on redemption''s cost and respond with grateful surrender.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined redemption. Today we explore its results: freedom from sin''s power, not just penalty.

"For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace" (Romans 6:14). Before redemption, we couldn''t not sin. After redemption, we can choose righteousness. The compulsive power is broken.

This doesn''t mean we''re sinless but that we''re no longer helpless. We can resist, repent, and grow. "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Galatians 5:16). Today we embrace freedom''s reality and responsibility.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored freedom from sin''s power. Today we address ongoing sin: what happens when redeemed people still sin?

Christians still sin—not as lifestyle but as lapses. "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves" (1 John 1:8). What then?

"If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One" (1 John 2:1). Christ intercedes for us. We confess, receive forgiveness, and continue growing. Ongoing sin doesn''t cancel redemption but should decrease over time as the Spirit transforms us. Today we find grace for the ongoing journey.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed ongoing sin. Today we explore restitution: making right what we''ve wronged.

Zacchaeus, after encountering Jesus, declared: "If I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount" (Luke 19:8). Genuine repentance often involves practical restoration where possible.

Restitution isn''t earning forgiveness (that''s already given) but demonstrating sincerity. It may include: returning stolen goods, paying debts, seeking reconciliation with those wronged, or making public what was publicly damaged. Today we consider whether any restitution is needed.',
day10_context = 'We''ve journeyed through sin''s nature, repentance''s reality, confession''s practice, redemption''s cost, freedom''s gift, ongoing grace, and restitution''s role. Today we commit to living as redeemed people.

"You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Redemption changes ownership—we belong to Christ now.

As you complete this study, how will you live differently? What sins need ongoing battle? What freedoms need embracing? What restorations need making? Live as who you are: redeemed, forgiven, and free.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored serving others as growth catalyst. Today we examine another remedy: fresh encounter with Scripture.

When spiritually stuck, return to basics: "Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation" (1 Peter 2:2). Sometimes we need milk again before returning to meat.

Try a different approach: a new translation, audio Bible, devotional guide, or systematic reading plan. Read expectantly—ask God to speak. Journal insights. Memorize passages. Sometimes spiritual dryness results from abandoned disciplines. Today we recommit to Scripture engagement.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed fresh Scripture encounter. Today we explore worship as breakthrough—praise that shifts perspective.

Paul and Silas, beaten and imprisoned, prayed and sang hymns at midnight (Acts 16:25). Their circumstances didn''t change (yet), but their perspective did. Worship refocuses attention from problems to God.

When stuck, worship anyway. Sing even if you don''t feel like it. Praise God for who He is regardless of how you feel. "Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise" (Psalm 100:4). The sacrifice of praise often precedes the sense of His presence. Today we worship our way through stuckness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined worship as breakthrough. Today we address a possible cause: unconfessed sin blocking growth.

"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened" (Psalm 66:18). Unconfessed sin creates distance. Spiritual stagnation sometimes signals hidden rebellion.

Ask the Spirit to search your heart (Psalm 139:23-24). What have you been avoiding? What rationalizations have you made? What commands are you ignoring? Confession clears the channel for grace to flow again. Today we invite the searchlight of the Spirit into dark corners.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined unconfessed sin. Today we explore seasons: not all spiritual dryness indicates problems.

Even healthy plants have dormant seasons. Spiritual winter can prepare for spring growth. "I will not always accuse, nor will I harbor my anger forever" (Isaiah 57:16). God knows seasons vary.

Some dryness results from: emotional exhaustion, physical depletion, overwhelming circumstances, or God''s intentional hiddenness to strengthen faith. The key: keep seeking, keep obeying, keep trusting—even when feeling nothing. Today we normalize seasons while not using them as excuses.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 normalized spiritual seasons. Today we address another remedy: getting outside yourself through generosity.

"One person gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty" (Proverbs 11:24). Counter-intuitively, giving when we feel empty can bring filling.

Generosity with money, time, energy, and attention breaks the inward spiral of self-focus. We discover that we have more to give than we thought. And in giving, we often receive. Today we practice generosity as a pathway through spiritual stagnation.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored: spiritual friendship, serving others, fresh Scripture engagement, worship, confession, recognizing seasons, and generosity. Today we commit to implementing what we''ve learned.

"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up" (Galatians 6:9). The promise is conditional: we reap if we don''t give up.

As you complete this study, which remedies will you apply? Make a specific plan: which friend will you pursue? What service will you offer? How will you engage Scripture freshly? Don''t stay stuck—take action and trust God for breakthrough.'

"Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD" (Psalm 27:14). Biblical waiting isn''t passive resignation but active expectation. It''s not giving up but holding on.

Abraham waited twenty-five years for Isaac. Joseph waited thirteen years from dreams to throne. Israel waited four hundred years in Egypt. God''s timing rarely matches ours—but it''s always perfect. "He has made everything beautiful in its time" (Ecclesiastes 3:11). Today we practice expectant waiting.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored waiting on God. Today we examine what perseverance produces: proven character.

"We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope" (Romans 5:3-4). Perseverance isn''t just endurance for its own sake; it''s forming something in us.

Character developed through difficulty is tested character—reliable, proven, trustworthy. It can''t be developed any other way. The shortcut-culture wants results without process, but God grows character through time and testing. Today we embrace the process.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined character development. Today we explore perseverance''s inspiration: the example of Jesus.

"Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart" (Hebrews 12:3). Jesus is our model for endurance. He faced rejection, misunderstanding, betrayal, and crucifixion—and endured.

"For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God" (Hebrews 12:2). Joy ahead enabled endurance now. Today we fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 looked to Jesus'' example. Today we examine perseverance''s community: we need each other.

"Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another" (Hebrews 10:25). Isolation kills perseverance; community sustains it.

We need others to: remind us of truth when we forget, encourage us when we flag, hold us accountable when we drift, and share our burdens when they''re heavy. "Two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). Today we invest in perseverance-sustaining community.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 emphasized community. Today we explore perseverance''s perspective: keeping eyes on the finish.

"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness" (2 Timothy 4:7-8). Paul viewed life as a race with a finish line and reward.

How we finish matters more than how we start. Many who began with enthusiasm have dropped out. "Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor''s crown" (Revelation 2:10). Today we set our gaze on the finish.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored patience, perseverance, endurance, waiting, character development, Jesus'' example, community support, and the finish line. Today we commit to running our race.

"When your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase... then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God" (Deuteronomy 8:13-14). Success is dangerous to humility.

Humble success remembers: "It is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth" (Deuteronomy 8:18). Every good thing is gift. Achievement doesn''t make us superior; it increases stewardship responsibility. Today we practice gratitude that guards against pride in success.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed humility in success. Today we examine humility in failure—learning without being crushed.

Peter failed spectacularly—denying Jesus three times. Yet he was restored and became a pillar of the early church. Failure is humbling; how we respond determines whether it becomes formative or destructive.

Humble failure: acknowledges the wrong without excuse, receives forgiveness without earning it, learns what can be learned, and moves forward without endless self-condemnation. "Though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again" (Proverbs 24:16). Today we practice humble recovery.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined humility in failure. Today we explore obedience when it doesn''t make sense—trusting God''s wisdom over our own.

Abraham was told to sacrifice Isaac—the son of promise. It made no sense. Yet "early the next morning Abraham got up" (Genesis 22:3). He obeyed without recorded argument.

"Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). Sometimes God''s commands seem illogical. Obedience demonstrates trust in His character and wisdom. Today we identify areas where obedience requires trust beyond understanding.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored obedience beyond understanding. Today we examine obedience in small things—faithfulness in the everyday.

"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much" (Luke 16:10). Small obedience prepares for large responsibility. Character is built in minor decisions.

Daily obedience includes: speaking truth in casual conversations, giving generously when amounts seem insignificant, serving when no one notices, and maintaining integrity in small transactions. These "little" acts form the person who can handle bigger tests. Today we commit to small faithfulness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined small obedience. Today we explore the relationship between love and obedience.

"If you love me, keep my commands" (John 14:15). Obedience isn''t opposed to love; it''s love''s expression. Children who love their parents want to please them. We obey not to earn love but because we''ve received it.

"This is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome" (1 John 5:3). When we love God, obedience isn''t grudging duty but glad response. Today we examine whether our obedience flows from love or mere obligation.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored humility in relationship, in success, in failure; and obedience when it''s hard, in small things, and from love. Today we embrace the humble, obedient life.

"What does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). Humble walking with God summarizes faithful living.

As you complete this study, where does pride still lurk? Where does disobedience persist? Humility and obedience aren''t natural—they''re gifts of grace we receive and cultivate. Walk humbly, obey gladly, and watch God work.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined what waiting produces. Today we explore waiting actively—it''s not passive resignation but engaged trust.

"Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him" (Psalm 37:7). "Stillness" isn''t inactivity but ceasing striving. We continue doing what we can while trusting God with what we can''t.

Active waiting includes: continued prayer, faithful obedience in known duties, growing in character, serving others, and maintaining readiness for when God acts. Waiting isn''t hitting pause on life but living fully while trusting God''s timing. Today we practice active waiting.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored active waiting. Today we address waiting''s emotions—what to do when impatience, doubt, or despair arise.

The psalms model honest emotional expression: "How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1). We can bring frustration, confusion, and even anger to God. He''s not threatened by our emotions.

But notice: even psalms of lament usually move toward trust. Express the emotion, then redirect to truth. "But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation" (Psalm 13:5). Today we practice honest emotion that resolves in trust.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed waiting''s emotions. Today we explore examples: people who waited and saw God act.

Hannah waited years for a child, pouring out her anguish to God, until Samuel was granted. David was anointed king as a teenager but didn''t reign until thirty—years of fugitive existence between promise and fulfillment. The early church waited ten days for the Spirit after Jesus ascended.

Their waiting wasn''t wasted—it prepared them for what was coming. God uses waiting to ready us for His answers. Today we draw encouragement from those who waited before us.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined biblical examples. Today we address waiting that doesn''t end as expected—when God''s answer isn''t what we wanted.

Sometimes God says no. Paul prayed three times for his "thorn" to be removed; God said, "My grace is sufficient" (2 Corinthians 12:9). The answer wasn''t removal but sufficiency.

Mature faith trusts God''s wisdom when answers differ from requests. "Your ways are higher than my ways and your thoughts than my thoughts" (Isaiah 55:9). Today we prepare for the possibility that waiting ends differently than we hoped—and God remains good.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed unexpected answers. Today we explore waiting together—community support during seasons of waiting.

"Carry each other''s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2). We need others when waiting is hard—people who pray with us, encourage us, and remind us of truth.

Others have waited and seen God act. Their testimonies strengthen our faith. "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses... let us run with perseverance" (Hebrews 12:1). Today we lean into community during our waiting seasons.',

"The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him; it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD" (Lamentations 3:25-26). Waiting isn''t just tolerable; it''s good.

"If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18). Peace with God should overflow into peace with others. But notice the qualifiers: "if possible" and "as far as it depends on you." Some people won''t be reconciled.

We do our part: forgive, seek reconciliation, refuse to retaliate, pray for enemies. We can''t control others'' responses, but we can control ours. Today we examine relational peace: Who might God want you to pursue?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed relational peace. Today we explore peace in decision-making—how God''s peace guides.

"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts" (Colossians 3:15). The word "rule" means "umpire"—peace acts as referee, calling decisions safe or out.

When facing decisions, pray and note where peace rests. Lingering unease may signal caution; settled peace may confirm direction. This isn''t the only guidance factor, but it''s significant. "The mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace" (Romans 8:6). Today we practice listening for peace''s guidance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored peace in decisions. Today we address peace amidst chaos—the peace that makes no sense.

The peace Jesus gives "transcends all understanding" (Philippians 4:7). It doesn''t depend on circumstances making sense. Stephen, being stoned, saw heaven open (Acts 7:56). Paul and Silas sang in prison (Acts 16:25). Peace doesn''t require understanding—it requires trusting the One who understands.

When circumstances are chaotic, peace becomes most remarkable. It witnesses to watching others that something supernatural is at work. Today we welcome peace that defies logic.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored peace amidst chaos. Today we examine peace-stealers: what robs our peace and how to respond.

Common peace-stealers include: worry about the future, regret about the past, comparison with others, unforgiveness, unconfessed sin, and unbelief. Each has a remedy: prayer for worry, forgiveness for regret, contentment for comparison, releasing debts for unforgiveness, confession for sin, and trust for unbelief.

Identifying what steals your peace is half the battle. Once identified, apply the appropriate remedy. Today we name our peace-stealers and address them.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 identified peace-stealers. Today we explore becoming peacemakers—extending the peace we''ve received.

"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9). Receiving peace makes us peace-givers. We become instruments of God''s peace in a fractured world.

Peacemaking includes: reconciling estranged parties, calming anxious hearts, speaking truth that settles confusion, and modeling peace that draws questions. "The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever" (Isaiah 32:17). Today we commit to spreading peace.',

Lament has structure: address to God, complaint, trust expression, petition, and often praise. It takes pain to God rather than away from Him. Grief expressed to God becomes grief that heals. Today we learn to lament biblically.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored lament. Today we address unanswered questions: when brokenness persists and answers don''t come.

Job never learned why he suffered. He received God''s presence but not explanations. Sometimes we won''t understand until heaven—if then.

"We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him" (Romans 8:28). We know God is working even when we can''t see how. Faith trusts His character when circumstances don''t make sense. Today we practice trusting without understanding.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed unanswered questions. Today we explore community in brokenness—we need each other.

"Carry each other''s burdens" (Galatians 6:2). The brokenhearted need others: to listen, to be present, to pray, to help practically. Isolation makes brokenness worse; community makes it bearable.

This requires vulnerability—admitting we''re broken. It also requires availability—making time for broken friends. "Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn" (Romans 12:15). Today we examine both giving and receiving support in community.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 emphasized community. Today we explore moving forward—how healing progresses without forgetting.

Healing doesn''t mean forgetting or pretending the pain didn''t happen. It means integrating the experience into who we''re becoming. Scars remain but no longer dominate.

"See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?" (Isaiah 43:19). God specializes in new beginnings. The brokenhearted can hope again, love again, trust again—carefully, gradually, but genuinely. Today we look for signs of new growth.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored moving forward. Today we examine purpose in pain—how God redeems brokenness for others'' good.

Joseph told his brothers: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:20). God doesn''t waste pain. What broke us often becomes our ministry to others.

Paul wrote: "The God of all comfort... comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). Your brokenness qualifies you to minister to the similarly broken. Today we consider how God might use our pain.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored God''s nearness, lament, unanswered questions, community, moving forward, and purpose in pain. Today we trust the Healer.

"He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds" (Psalm 147:3). God is the healer. Our role is coming to Him, receiving His comfort, and walking forward with Him.

As you complete this study, where are you in the healing journey? What support do you need? How might God use your experience? The Lord is near to the brokenhearted. Draw near to Him.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined eternal perspective. Today we explore standing firm through the Spirit''s power—not our strength.

"Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD Almighty" (Zechariah 4:6). Standing firm requires supernatural strength. Our resolve cracks; His doesn''t.

"I can do all this through him who gives me strength" (Philippians 4:13). Notice: through Him, not by ourselves. We don''t grit our teeth and try harder; we depend on the Spirit''s enabling. Today we shift from self-effort to Spirit-dependence.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 emphasized Spirit-dependence. Today we explore the word of God as weapon—Scripture in pressure situations.

Jesus faced Satan''s temptation with Scripture: "It is written..." (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10). The "sword of the Spirit" is "the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17). Scripture memorized becomes ammunition available under pressure.

When pressured to compromise, having truth ready enables resistance. "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11). Today we identify Scriptures to memorize for our specific pressure points.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined Scripture as weapon. Today we address standing firm together—community strength.

"Two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). Isolated Christians fall more easily. Community provides accountability, encouragement, and strength in numbers.

Daniel stood firm with friends—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shared his convictions. They reinforced each other''s resolve. Who stands with you? Who do you stand with? Today we strengthen community connections.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 emphasized community. Today we explore counting the cost—being realistic about pressure''s price.

Jesus said, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me" (Matthew 16:24). Discipleship costs. Standing firm may mean lost opportunities, damaged relationships, or material loss.

Counting the cost beforehand prevents surprise and regret later. "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won''t you first sit down and estimate the cost?" (Luke 14:28). Today we honestly assess what standing firm might cost—and confirm it''s worth it.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined counting the cost. Today we explore standing firm joyfully—not grimly enduring but genuinely thriving.

"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds" (James 1:2). Not joy because of trials but in them. This isn''t masochism but perspective: trials produce proven character.

Peter wrote that believers "are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy" even though suffering (1 Peter 1:6-8). Standing firm can be joyful because we know who wins in the end. Today we cultivate joy under pressure.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored strategies, Spirit-power, Scripture, community, cost-counting, and joy. Today we commit to standing.

"After you have done everything, stand" (Ephesians 6:13). The goal is simple: when the pressure ends, still be standing. Not knocked down, not compromised, not defeated—standing.

As you complete this study, what pressures do you face? What preparations will you make? Who stands with you? "Stand firm. Let nothing move you" (1 Corinthians 15:58). The One who stands with you has already overcome the world.'

-- FRIENDSHIP GOD'S WAY
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored spiritual friendship. Today we examine the hard part of friendship: speaking truth even when difficult.

"Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses" (Proverbs 27:6). True friends tell us what we need to hear, not just what we want to hear. This requires courage and love.

"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow up into... Christ" (Ephesians 4:15). Truth without love wounds unnecessarily; love without truth enables destruction. Today we consider: Do we have friends who speak truth? Are we that friend to others?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined speaking truth. Today we explore loyalty—faithfulness through changing seasons.

"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity" (Proverbs 17:17). Fair-weather friends disappear when trouble comes. True friends stand closer in hard times.

Ruth''s loyalty to Naomi is legendary: "Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay" (Ruth 1:16). This commitment through difficulty defines friendship. Today we examine our loyalty: Do we stay when staying is hard?',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored loyalty. Today we address friendship boundaries—wisdom about how close to let people in.

Not everyone can be a close friend. Jesus had the twelve, but within them three (Peter, James, John), and within them one "whom Jesus loved." Intimacy requires capacity limits.

Some relationships are healthy at a distance but toxic up close. Wisdom discerns appropriate boundaries. "Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm" (Proverbs 13:20). Today we evaluate friendship boundaries—who to draw closer, who to love from further away.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed boundaries. Today we explore making new friends—the courage to initiate.

"A man who has friends must himself be friendly" (Proverbs 18:24 NKJV). Friendship requires initiative. Someone must extend first, risk rejection, and pursue connection.

Adults often find making new friends difficult. Busyness, self-consciousness, and established patterns work against new connections. Yet new friendships enrich life and expand God''s work in us. Today we consider who God might be calling us to pursue as a friend.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored making new friends. Today we examine being a good friend—what we bring to relationships.

"Do to others as you would have them do to you" (Luke 6:31). The Golden Rule applies to friendship. What do you want in a friend? Be that.

Good friends: listen more than talk, show up in crisis, keep confidences, celebrate others'' successes without jealousy, speak truth gently, forgive readily, and point each other to Christ. Today we honestly assess: What kind of friend am I?',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored friendship''s qualities, spiritual depth, truth-speaking, loyalty, boundaries, initiative, and self-examination. Today we commit to godly friendship.

"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor... A cord of three strands is not quickly broken" (Ecclesiastes 4:9, 12). The third strand is God—friendships centered on Him are strongest.

As you complete this study, what friendships need deepening? What new connections need initiating? What qualities need developing in yourself? Invest in godly friendships—they''re worth the effort.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined practical service. Today we explore serving the undeserving—grace in action.

Jesus washed the feet of disciples who would abandon, deny, and betray Him. He knew what was coming yet served anyway. His service wasn''t based on recipients'' worthiness but on His character.

"While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). We serve not because people deserve it but because we''ve received undeserved grace. Today we consider serving those we might otherwise overlook or avoid.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed serving the undeserving. Today we examine serving faithfully when unnoticed—hidden service.

"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them" (Matthew 6:1). Some service is necessarily public, but our motivation shouldn''t be public recognition.

Jesus served in obscurity for thirty years before His public ministry. Hidden faithfulness prepared Him for visible impact. "Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you" (Matthew 6:4). Today we embrace hidden service that only God sees.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored hidden service. Today we address serving when tired—service that costs.

Jesus often served despite exhaustion. After learning of John the Baptist''s death, He sought solitude but was followed by crowds. "He had compassion on them and healed their sick" (Matthew 14:14). His fatigue didn''t eliminate His compassion.

We can''t serve everyone always—Jesus withdrew regularly. But we shouldn''t let discomfort always determine service. Sometimes we serve tired, inconvenienced, or stretched. Today we examine whether we serve only when convenient.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed serving tired. Today we explore serving through our gifts—matching ability with need.

"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God''s grace" (1 Peter 4:10). Effective service connects our gifts with others'' needs.

You can''t serve everyone in every way. But you can serve some people in some ways particularly well. What are you good at? What needs match those abilities? Today we identify service opportunities aligned with our gifts.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined serving through gifts. Today we explore serving together—team service is more effective than solo.

Jesus sent disciples "two by two" (Mark 6:7). The early church served together: "All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need" (Acts 2:44-45).

Team service: multiplies impact, provides accountability, encourages perseverance, and models community to those served. Today we consider serving alongside others rather than always alone.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored Jesus'' example, humility, practical service, serving the undeserving, hidden service, serving tired, gifts-based service, and team service. Today we commit to a servant life.

"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45). Jesus'' life was service; ours should be too.

As you complete this study, what specific service will you offer? Who will you serve this week? How will you develop as a servant? Follow Jesus in serving—it''s the path to true greatness.'

"I appeal to you, brothers and sisters... that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you" (1 Corinthians 1:10). Paul addressed real division over real issues.

Unity threats include: personality conflicts, doctrinal disputes over secondary matters, cultural differences, competition for resources or recognition, and gossip. Recognizing threats helps address them. Today we identify what threatens unity in our context.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 identified unity threats. Today we explore pursuing unity actively—it requires effort.

"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3). Unity doesn''t maintain itself; we must "make every effort."

Active pursuit includes: overlooking minor offenses, addressing major issues quickly, seeking understanding before judgment, choosing charitable interpretations, and prioritizing relationship over being right. Today we commit to active unity pursuit.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined active pursuit. Today we address unity amid disagreement—we won''t agree on everything.

Early Christians disagreed about meat, special days, and circumcision. Paul''s counsel: "Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters" (Romans 14:1). Distinguish essentials (non-negotiable) from non-essentials (where disagreement is permissible).

"In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity." This wisdom, attributed to various sources, captures biblical balance. Today we discern what''s essential and extend liberty elsewhere.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed disagreement. Today we explore unity''s witness—what it says to the watching world.

Jesus prayed "that all of them may be one... so that the world may believe" (John 17:21). Christian unity is evangelistic—it points others to Christ. Division, conversely, undermines witness.

"By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35). Our unity demonstrates gospel reality. The world notices how Christians treat each other. Today we consider how our unity (or disunity) affects witness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined unity''s witness. Today we explore reconciliation—restoring unity after it''s broken.

"First go and be reconciled to your brother or sister; then come and offer your gift" (Matthew 5:24). Broken relationships require initiative. Someone must move first.

Reconciliation includes: acknowledging wrong, asking forgiveness, releasing offenses, and rebuilding trust. It''s not pretending nothing happened but working through what did. Today we consider relationships needing reconciliation.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored unity''s basis, diversity, threats, active pursuit, disagreement navigation, witness, and reconciliation. Today we commit to being unity-builders.

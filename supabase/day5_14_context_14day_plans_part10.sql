SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the Spirit''s sanctifying work. Today we examine specific guidance—how does the Spirit lead?

"Those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God" (Romans 8:14). But how? Through Scripture (He never contradicts His Word), promptings, circumstances, counsel, and peace.

Leading isn''t always dramatic; often it''s quiet conviction or gentle direction. Today we grow in sensitivity to His leading.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored guidance. Today we examine the Spirit and prayer—He helps us pray.

"The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us" (Romans 8:26). When words fail, He prays.

Spirit-led prayer follows His prompts, prays Scripture, and rests in His intercession. Today we pray in the Spirit.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored prayer. Today we examine the Spirit and Scripture—He illuminates truth.

"The Spirit will guide you into all the truth" (John 16:13). The Spirit who inspired Scripture also illuminates it. He opens minds to understand.

Spirit-led reading asks for His help, expects Him to teach, and responds to what He reveals. Today we read with Spirit-reliance.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Scripture illumination. Today we examine the Spirit and witness—He empowers testimony.

"You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8). Boldness, words, effectiveness—all Spirit-provided.

Spirit-led witness follows His prompts, speaks His words, and trusts Him with results. Today we witness in Spirit-power.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored witness. Today we examine the Spirit and community—He distributes gifts for the body.

"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them... for the common good" (1 Corinthians 12:4, 7). Every believer is gifted; every gift serves others.

Spirit-led community uses gifts for blessing, not showing off. Today we discover and deploy our gifts.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored gifts. Today we examine walking in the Spirit—moment-by-moment dependence.

"Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Galatians 5:16). Walking implies: ongoing movement, each step dependent, consistent direction.

Spirit-walking is daily, hourly awareness and dependence. Today we practice Spirit-walking.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored walking. Today we address not grieving the Spirit—He can be hurt.

"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God" (Ephesians 4:30). The context mentions: lying, anger, stealing, unwholesome talk, bitterness, rage. These grieve Him.

The Spirit is a Person who feels. Our sin hurts Him. Today we commit to not grieving our Guest.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed grieving. Today we examine not quenching the Spirit—letting Him work.

"Do not quench the Spirit" (1 Thessalonians 5:19). The image is fire—we can suppress what He wants to do. Quenching resists His promptings.

Spirit-led living allows Him freedom, follows His prompts, and welcomes His work. Today we stop quenching.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed quenching. Today we examine being filled with the Spirit—ongoing experience.

"Be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18). The command is continuous: keep being filled. This isn''t one-time but ongoing.

Filling involves: surrender, confession, invitation, and faith. Today we seek fresh filling.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored Spirit-led living: His presence, fruit, sanctification, guidance, prayer, Scripture, witness, community, walking, grieving, quenching, and filling.

"Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit" (Galatians 5:25).

As you complete this study, how will you follow the Spirit more closely? He indwells you. Walk with Him.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the promise of provision. Today we examine the promise of wisdom—"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God" (James 1:5).

Hard times require decisions we don''t know how to make. God promises wisdom to those who ask without doubting.

Wisdom isn''t just information but skill for living—knowing what to do when the way isn''t clear. Today we claim wisdom for hard decisions.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored wisdom''s promise. Today we examine the promise of strength—"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13).

This verse isn''t about achieving anything we want but about contentment in any circumstance. Paul wrote from prison about contentment in plenty or want.

Christ strengthens us for whatever we face. Today we receive strength for our situation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored strength''s promise. Today we examine the promise of peace—"My peace I give you" (John 14:27).

Jesus offered peace the world can''t give—peace independent of circumstances. This peace guards hearts and minds (Philippians 4:7).

Turmoil without, peace within. Today we receive the peace Jesus promised.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored peace''s promise. Today we examine the promise of comfort—"God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).

God specializes in comfort. He comforts so we can comfort others with the same comfort we received.

Hard times position us to receive and then give comfort. Today we receive God''s comfort.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored comfort''s promise. Today we examine the promise of purpose—"God works all things together for good" (Romans 8:28).

This doesn''t mean all things are good but that God weaves even bad things into good purposes. The promise is for "those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."

Nothing is wasted in God''s economy. Today we trust His purposeful working.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored purpose''s promise. Today we examine the promise of grace sufficient—"My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Corinthians 12:9).

Paul begged for relief; God offered grace instead. The thorn remained; grace sustained.

Sometimes God removes hardship; sometimes He gives grace to endure it. Today we receive sufficient grace.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored sufficient grace. Today we examine the promise of eventual joy—"Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning" (Psalm 30:5).

Night doesn''t last forever. Morning comes. Tears will give way to joy—if not in this life, certainly in the next.

"He will wipe every tear from their eyes" (Revelation 21:4). Today we hold onto eventual joy.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored eventual joy. Today we examine the promise of eternal perspective—"Our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory" (2 Corinthians 4:17).

Present suffering, however heavy, is "light" compared to eternal glory. Affliction is "momentary" against forever.

Eternal perspective doesn''t minimize present pain but contextualizes it. Today we gain perspective.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored eternal perspective. Today we examine the promise of ultimate victory—"In all these things we are more than conquerors" (Romans 8:37).

Not just survivors but conquerors—more than conquerors. Present hardship doesn''t determine ultimate outcome.

"The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (Romans 16:20). Victory is certain. Today we live as victors.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored promises for hard times: God''s presence, never being forsaken, provision, wisdom, strength, peace, comfort, purpose, sufficient grace, eventual joy, eternal perspective, and ultimate victory.

"Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave" (1 Kings 8:56).

As you complete this study, which promises will you hold onto? God keeps His word. Believe it.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored God meeting us in darkness. Today we examine physical factors—depression isn''t only spiritual.

Elijah was depressed; God''s first prescription was food and sleep (1 Kings 19:5-7). Sometimes spiritual problems have physical components.

Sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, lack of exercise, medical conditions—all can affect mood. Caring for your body is spiritual discipline. Today we address physical factors.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed physical factors. Today we explore the value of community—we need others.

"Carry each other''s burdens" (Galatians 6:2). Depression often isolates; healing often requires connection.

Elijah thought he was alone; he wasn''t. You''re not alone either. Today we push against isolation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored community. Today we address when professional help is needed—wisdom, not weakness.

Depression sometimes indicates clinical conditions requiring medical treatment. Seeking help isn''t failure; it''s wisdom.

God uses counselors, doctors, and medication. Don''t resist help out of false pride. Today we normalize appropriate professional help.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed professional help. Today we explore hope as anchor—holding when everything shakes.

"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure" (Hebrews 6:19). Anchors hold in storms. Hope holds when feelings sink.

Hope isn''t optimism but confidence in God''s character and promises. Today we anchor in hope.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored hope. Today we examine gratitude''s power—it shifts focus.

"Give thanks in all circumstances" (1 Thessalonians 5:18). Not for all circumstances but in them. Gratitude redirects attention from what''s wrong to what''s right.

Gratitude is discipline, not feeling. Today we practice thankfulness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored gratitude. Today we examine truth versus feelings—feelings lie.

Depression distorts perception. Everything looks darker than it is. "There is no hope" feels true but isn''t.

"The heart is deceitful above all things" (Jeremiah 17:9). Trust truth over feelings. Today we align with truth.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed feelings versus truth. Today we explore small steps—progress, not perfection.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Depression makes everything overwhelming. Break it down.

One day at a time. One task at a time. One step at a time. Today we take small steps forward.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored small steps. Today we examine serving others—looking outward helps.

"In humility value others above yourselves" (Philippians 2:3). When we focus on others'' needs, our own pain loses some power.

This isn''t denial but perspective. Serving breaks the inward spiral. Today we consider serving.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored serving. Today we address patience with the process—healing takes time.

"Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord''s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop" (James 5:7). Farmers don''t rush harvest.

Recovery isn''t instant. Progress matters more than pace. Today we practice patience.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored encouragement for depression: biblical examples, God in darkness, physical factors, community, professional help, hope, gratitude, truth, small steps, serving, and patience.

"The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit" (Psalm 34:18).

As you complete this study, what will you implement? You''re not alone. God is near. There is hope.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored suffering producing endurance. Today we examine suffering and empathy—it qualifies us to comfort others.

"The God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).

Your suffering isn''t wasted—it becomes ministry equipment. Today we see suffering''s redemptive purpose.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored empathy from suffering. Today we examine Jesus'' suffering—He understands.

"We do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses" (Hebrews 4:15). Jesus suffered: hunger, exhaustion, rejection, betrayal, abandonment, physical torture, death.

He doesn''t observe from distance; He understands from experience. Today we approach One who gets it.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored Jesus'' understanding. Today we examine suffering as identification with Christ—sharing His experience.

"I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings" (Philippians 3:10). Paul saw suffering as fellowship with Christ.

Suffering with Christ connects us to Him in unique ways. Today we reframe suffering as connection.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored identification with Christ. Today we examine present suffering versus future glory—it''s not proportional.

"Our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us" (Romans 8:18). Present pain, however intense, is outweighed by coming glory.

Eternal perspective doesn''t minimize present pain but contextualizes it. Today we weigh suffering against glory.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored glory outweighing suffering. Today we examine lament as worship—bringing pain to God honestly.

The Psalms overflow with lament: "How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1). Lament is not doubt but faith that brings pain to God.

Honest cries are worship too. Today we bring our pain to God.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored lament. Today we examine God''s sovereignty over suffering—He''s not absent or powerless.

"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:20). God doesn''t cause all suffering, but He sovereignly works through it.

Mystery remains, but so does sovereignty. Today we trust the Sovereign in suffering.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored sovereignty. Today we examine community in suffering—we''re not meant to suffer alone.

"If one part suffers, every part suffers with it" (1 Corinthians 12:26). The body shares pain.

Let others in. Receive help. Share the burden. Today we accept community support.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored community. Today we examine suffering preparing us for eternity—affliction produces glory.

"Our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (2 Corinthians 4:17). Suffering achieves something—it produces eternal weight.

Present pain accomplishes future gain. Today we see suffering''s eternal purpose.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored eternal purpose. Today we examine holding on to hope—it''s anchor in storms.

"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure" (Hebrews 6:19). Hope anchors when circumstances shake.

Hope isn''t wishful thinking but confident expectation based on God''s character and promises. Today we anchor in hope.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored hope in suffering: suffering''s reality, purpose, and path, character development, empathy, Jesus'' understanding, identification with Christ, glory comparison, lament, sovereignty, community, eternal purpose, and hope.

"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair" (2 Corinthians 4:8).

As you complete this study, how has your perspective on suffering shifted? Hold onto hope. Glory is coming.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the armor of God''s introduction. Today we begin examining each piece: the belt of truth.

"Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist" (Ephesians 6:14). Roman soldiers tucked garments into belts; without them, they''d trip. Truth holds everything together.

Satan is the father of lies (John 8:44). Truth exposes lies. Today we put on truth.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored truth. Today we examine the breastplate of righteousness—protecting the heart.

"With the breastplate of righteousness in place" (Ephesians 6:14). The breastplate protected vital organs. Righteousness protects our hearts from accusation.

This is Christ''s righteousness credited to us and practical righteousness in daily living. Both protect. Today we wear righteousness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored righteousness. Today we examine feet fitted with gospel readiness—stability and mobility.

"With your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace" (Ephesians 6:15). Roman soldiers wore sandals with spikes for traction.

The gospel gives us firm footing and mobilizes us for mission. Today we stand firm and advance.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored gospel readiness. Today we examine the shield of faith—extinguishing attacks.

"Take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one" (Ephesians 6:16). Roman shields could interlock and be soaked to quench fire arrows.

Doubt, fear, temptation—faith extinguishes them. Today we raise faith''s shield.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored faith. Today we examine the helmet of salvation—protecting the mind.

"Take the helmet of salvation" (Ephesians 6:17). Helmets protect heads—where thoughts happen.

Knowing we''re saved protects against mental attacks: "You''re not really saved." "God has abandoned you." "You''ve sinned too much." Today we secure our minds with salvation''s assurance.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored salvation''s helmet. Today we examine the sword of the Spirit—the only offensive weapon.

"The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17). Jesus countered Satan''s temptations with "It is written." Scripture is our weapon.

This requires knowing Scripture—you can''t use a sword left at home. Today we sharpen our sword.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored the sword. Today we examine prayer as spiritual warfare—essential to the battle.

"Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests" (Ephesians 6:18). Prayer follows the armor description because prayer deploys the armor.

Armor without prayer is like soldiers without orders. Today we fight through prayer.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored prayer. Today we address how Satan attacks—knowing the enemy.

Satan attacks through: lies (John 8:44), temptation (Matthew 4), accusation (Revelation 12:10), division (1 Corinthians 3:3), and distraction.

Knowing his strategies helps us prepare. Today we recognize attack patterns.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored Satan''s strategies. Today we examine resisting the devil—he flees when we do.

"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). Note the order: submit to God first, then resist Satan.

Resistance isn''t passive but active—speaking truth, praying, refusing to yield. Today we actively resist.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored spiritual warfare: the reality, the enemy, the battle, the armor (truth, righteousness, gospel, faith, salvation, Scripture), prayer, and resistance.

"The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (Romans 16:20).

As you complete this study, is your armor in place? Are you wielding the sword? The battle is real; the victory is certain. Fight well.'

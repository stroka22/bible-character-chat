SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the ministry of presence. Today we examine types of grief—it comes in many forms.

Grief includes: death of loved ones, divorce, job loss, health decline, miscarriage, broken relationships, unfulfilled dreams, and life transitions. Each loss deserves acknowledgment.

"There is a time for everything... a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance" (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 4). Grief is appropriate response to loss. Today we validate the many forms grief takes.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored types of grief. Today we address grief''s stages—the path through mourning.

Common stages include: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. These aren''t linear—people cycle through them differently.

Understanding stages helps normalize the experience. Feeling angry doesn''t mean faithless. Bargaining is natural. Depression is expected. Today we recognize where we are in grief''s journey without rushing the process.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored grief''s stages. Today we examine how not to grieve—"as others do who have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13).

Christian grief differs from hopeless grief. We mourn, but not without hope. We weep, but with resurrection confidence. We feel loss, but not permanent separation from those in Christ.

"If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him" (1 Thessalonians 4:14). Hope transforms grief. Today we grieve with hope.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored hopeful grief. Today we address when grief becomes complicated—sometimes professional help is needed.

Grief that doesn''t progress, that completely disrupts functioning for extended periods, or that leads to self-harm needs professional attention. This isn''t weakness; it''s wisdom.

"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" (Proverbs 15:22). Counselors, pastors, and grief support groups can help. Today we normalize seeking help for complicated grief.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed complicated grief. Today we explore comfort from Scripture—specific passages for grieving hearts.

Psalm 23: "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me." Psalm 34:18: "The LORD is close to the brokenhearted." John 14:1-3: "I go to prepare a place for you." Revelation 21:4: "He will wipe every tear."

Scripture provides words when we have none, hope when we see none, and presence when we feel alone. Today we meditate on comforting passages.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Scripture comfort. Today we examine comfort from community—we need each other.

"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).

Community provides: presence (just being there), practical help (meals, errands), listening ears (letting us talk), and shared tears. Today we receive and give community comfort.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored community comfort. Today we address the question "Why?"—it''s natural but often unanswered.

Job asked why; God answered with His presence, not explanations. Sometimes we won''t understand. "Now I know in part; then I shall know fully" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Complete understanding awaits heaven.

What we do know: God is good, God is sovereign, and God is with us. We can trust His character when we can''t trace His ways. Today we accept mystery while trusting the Mysterious One.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed the "why" question. Today we explore continuing bonds—honoring the deceased while moving forward.

Grief doesn''t mean forgetting. We can honor memories, tell stories, and maintain appropriate connections while also moving forward. The goal isn''t "getting over" but "living with."

Healthy continuing bonds include: celebrating anniversaries appropriately, keeping meaningful mementos, sharing memories, and allowing the deceased''s positive influence to continue. Today we explore healthy continuing bonds.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored continuing bonds. Today we examine helping grieving children—they process differently.

Children grieve according to developmental understanding. Young children may not grasp permanence. Teenagers may mask grief or act out. All need honest, age-appropriate information and permission to feel.

"Let the little children come to me" (Mark 10:14). Jesus welcomed children; we should comfort them. Today we explore helping children through grief.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored grief: God as comforter, lament, presence ministry, types and stages, hopeful grieving, complicated grief, Scripture and community comfort, unanswered questions, continuing bonds, and grieving children.

"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted" (Matthew 5:4). Mourning opens us to divine comfort.

As you complete this study, where are you in the grief journey? What comfort have you received? What comfort can you give? God is near to the brokenhearted—draw near to Him.'

-- BIBLICAL LEADERSHIP 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored vision. Today we examine communication—leaders must convey vision compellingly.

Nehemiah communicated the vision for rebuilding Jerusalem''s walls clearly: "You see the trouble we are in... Come, let us rebuild." The people responded: "Let us start rebuilding" (Nehemiah 2:17-18). Clear communication produced unified action.

Good communication includes: clarity (people understand), inspiration (people want to participate), and repetition (people remember). Today we develop communication skills for leadership.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined communication. Today we explore decision-making—leaders face constant choices.

Moses was advised by Jethro to delegate decisions: handle only the difficult cases personally (Exodus 18:22). Wise leaders know what to decide and what to delegate.

Decision-making wisdom includes: gathering information, seeking counsel, considering consequences, praying for wisdom, and acting decisively. Indecision is itself a decision. Today we develop decision-making processes.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored decision-making. Today we examine handling criticism—it comes with leadership territory.

Moses faced constant criticism. David was mocked by Michal. Jesus was called a drunkard and demon-possessed. Leaders attract criticism.

Wisdom includes: listening for legitimate concerns, ignoring unfounded attacks, maintaining focus on mission, and not taking everything personally. "A gentle answer turns away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). Today we develop resilience for criticism.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed criticism. Today we explore developing others—leaders multiply themselves.

Jesus spent three years developing twelve disciples. Paul invested in Timothy, Titus, and others. Good leaders develop future leaders.

"The things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Four generations in one verse. Today we commit to developing others.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined developing others. Today we address leading through change—it''s always challenging.

Nehemiah led change against opposition. Jesus brought radical change to religious assumptions. Change produces resistance; leaders must navigate it.

Change leadership includes: communicating why change is necessary, involving people in the process, addressing concerns honestly, and maintaining patience. Today we develop change leadership skills.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored leading change. Today we examine leading yourself—you can''t lead others well if you''re not leading yourself.

Paul wrote: "I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified" (1 Corinthians 9:27). Self-leadership precedes public leadership.

Self-leadership includes: managing time, maintaining disciplines, guarding heart, developing continuously, and resting appropriately. Today we assess our self-leadership.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored self-leadership. Today we address leading in crisis—when everything goes wrong.

Nehemiah faced crisis: enemies threatened, workers despaired, resources ran low. His response: "Don''t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight" (Nehemiah 4:14). Prayer and action.

Crisis leadership requires: staying calm, communicating clearly, making decisions, and maintaining hope. Today we prepare for (or navigate) leadership in crisis.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed crisis leadership. Today we examine leading a team—you can''t accomplish much alone.

Jesus chose twelve. Nehemiah organized workers by family groups. Paul traveled with teams. Teams accomplish more than individuals.

Team leadership includes: choosing the right people, clarifying roles, empowering action, resolving conflict, and celebrating wins. Today we develop team leadership skills.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored team leadership. Today we address succession—good leaders prepare their replacement.

Moses invested in Joshua. Elijah mentored Elisha. Paul developed Timothy. Leaders who don''t plan succession leave vacuums.

"Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). Vision dies without succession. Who are you developing? What would happen if you left? Today we plan for succession.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored leadership: servant leadership, character, vision, communication, decisions, criticism, developing others, change, self-leadership, crisis, teams, and succession.

"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant" (Matthew 20:26). Jesus redefined greatness.

As you complete this study, what leadership growth do you need? What practices will you implement? Lead as Jesus led—with character, service, and vision.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 discussed spiritual disciplines. Today we examine the Church—you''re not meant to follow Jesus alone.

"Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing" (Hebrews 10:25). God places believers in community. The "one anothers" of Scripture require one anothers.

The church isn''t a building but a body—believers gathered for worship, teaching, fellowship, and mission. Finding and committing to a local church is essential for growth. Today we explore the importance of church.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored the Church. Today we examine baptism—the public declaration of faith.

"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins" (Acts 2:38). Baptism publicly identifies us with Christ''s death, burial, and resurrection.

Baptism doesn''t save (the thief on the cross wasn''t baptized), but it''s commanded for believers. It''s a starting point, an identification, and a testimony. Today we understand baptism''s significance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored baptism. Today we examine communion (the Lord''s Supper)—remembering Christ''s sacrifice.

"Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Jesus gave His followers a regular practice: bread representing His body, wine (or juice) representing His blood, taken together in remembrance.

Communion isn''t magic but memorial. It''s the church gathered around the table, remembering the cross, proclaiming His death until He comes (1 Corinthians 11:26). Today we understand communion''s meaning.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored communion. Today we examine dealing with sin—what happens when believers sin.

Christians still sin. "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves" (1 John 1:8). What then?

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). Confession brings forgiveness. We don''t lose our salvation, but we restore fellowship. Today we learn to deal with ongoing sin.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored dealing with sin. Today we examine the reality of spiritual battle—we have an enemy.

"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour" (1 Peter 5:8). Satan is real and active.

But "the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). We resist by submission to God, using Scripture, prayer, and the armor of God. Today we acknowledge spiritual warfare.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored spiritual battle. Today we examine sharing faith—the privilege and responsibility of witness.

"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect" (1 Peter 3:15). We''re witnesses of what we''ve experienced.

Sharing faith starts with living differently, then being ready to explain. Today we prepare to share our faith naturally.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored sharing faith. Today we examine giving—stewardship of God''s resources.

"Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Corinthians 9:7). Giving expresses trust and worship.

Everything belongs to God; we''re stewards. The tithe (10%) is a biblical starting point; generosity goes beyond. Today we develop a giving practice.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored giving. Today we examine suffering—why do bad things happen to believers?

Jesus promised: "In this world you will have trouble" (John 16:33). Christians aren''t exempt from suffering. But "take heart! I have overcome the world."

Suffering can refine faith, produce character, deepen dependence, and qualify us to comfort others (2 Corinthians 1:4). Today we develop a biblical perspective on suffering.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored suffering. Today we examine heaven—our certain hope.

"My Father''s house has many rooms... I am going there to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2). Heaven is real. Jesus is preparing it. We will be there.

Heaven is being with Christ forever, in resurrected bodies, in renewed creation, free from sin and suffering. This hope transforms present living. Today we anticipate our eternal home.',
day14_context = 'We''ve covered the basics: God, Jesus, salvation, Bible, prayer, Spirit, church, baptism, communion, sin, spiritual battle, sharing faith, giving, suffering, and heaven.

"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38-39).

As you complete this foundation, what will you build on it? Faith has only begun. Keep growing.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored El Shaddai. Today we examine Adonai—Lord, Master, Owner.

Adonai emphasizes God''s authority and our submission. When we call Him "Lord," we acknowledge His right to command and our obligation to obey.

"Why do you call me, ''Lord, Lord,'' and do not do what I say?" (Luke 6:46). Adonai isn''t just a title; it''s a relationship of obedience. Today we submit to Adonai.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored Adonai. Today we examine Yahweh Jireh—The LORD Who Provides.

When Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, God provided a ram. "Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide" (Genesis 22:14). The provider anticipated need before Abraham knew it existed.

Whatever you face, Yahweh Jireh has already seen it and prepared provision. Today we trust the Provider.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored Yahweh Jireh. Today we examine Yahweh Rapha—The LORD Who Heals.

"I am the LORD, who heals you" (Exodus 15:26). God is the source of healing—physical, emotional, spiritual. He healed in Scripture; He heals today.

Healing doesn''t always come when or how we expect. But we can always pray to the Healer and trust His wisdom. Today we bring our wounds to Yahweh Rapha.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Yahweh Rapha. Today we examine Yahweh Nissi—The LORD Is My Banner.

After defeating the Amalekites, Moses built an altar and named it Yahweh Nissi (Exodus 17:15). A banner was a rallying point in battle. God was their victory.

When life is battle, Yahweh Nissi is our rallying point. He leads us to victory. Today we fight under His banner.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Yahweh Nissi. Today we examine Yahweh Shalom—The LORD Is Peace.

Gideon built an altar after encountering God: "The LORD is Peace" (Judges 6:24). In anxious times, God gives peace beyond circumstances.

"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you" (John 14:27). Jesus extended the peace Yahweh always offered. Today we receive peace from Yahweh Shalom.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Yahweh Shalom. Today we examine Yahweh Rohi—The LORD Is My Shepherd.

"The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing" (Psalm 23:1). The shepherd provides, protects, guides, and cares for sheep who would otherwise be helpless.

Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep" (John 10:11). Yahweh Rohi gave His life for us. Today we follow our Shepherd.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Yahweh Rohi. Today we examine Yahweh Tsidkenu—The LORD Our Righteousness.

"This is the name by which he will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness" (Jeremiah 23:6). We can''t be righteous enough; He becomes our righteousness.

"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:21). Today we rest in Yahweh Tsidkenu—our righteousness comes from Him.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored Yahweh Tsidkenu. Today we examine Yahweh Shammah—The LORD Is There.

Ezekiel''s vision of the new Jerusalem concludes: "The name of the city from that time on will be: THE LORD IS THERE" (Ezekiel 48:35). God''s presence defines His people''s home.

"Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5). Wherever you go, Yahweh Shammah is there. Today we practice His presence.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored Yahweh Shammah. Today we examine Father—the New Testament revelation of intimate relationship.

Jesus introduced God as "Abba, Father" (Mark 14:36)—an intimate term, like "Dad" or "Papa." The holy God of the universe invites us into family.

"The Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, ''Abba, Father''" (Romans 8:15). Today we approach God as our Father.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored God''s names: Elohim, Yahweh, El Shaddai, Adonai, Yahweh Jireh, Rapha, Nissi, Shalom, Rohi, Tsidkenu, Shammah, and Father.

Each name reveals character. Together, they paint a portrait of who God is: powerful yet personal, holy yet near, sovereign yet intimate.

As you complete this study, which name speaks to your current situation? Call upon that name. He is who His names declare.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Jesus as Lord. Today we examine Him as Lamb of God—the sacrifice that takes away sin.

"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). John the Baptist saw Jesus and identified His mission: sacrifice.

Every Old Testament lamb pointed forward to Him. He is the Passover Lamb whose blood protects us from judgment. Today we worship the Lamb who was slain.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored Lamb of God. Today we examine Jesus as Good Shepherd—the one who cares for His sheep.

"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep" (John 10:11). Unlike hired hands who abandon sheep in danger, Jesus died for His.

He knows His sheep by name (10:3), leads them to good pasture, and protects them from wolves. Today we follow the Good Shepherd.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored Good Shepherd. Today we examine Jesus as Light of the World—illuminating darkness.

"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:12). In a world of confusion, He provides clarity.

Light exposes, guides, and enables life. Jesus does all three. Today we walk in His light.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Light of the World. Today we examine Jesus as Bread of Life—satisfying our deepest hunger.

"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty" (John 6:35). Bread sustains life; Jesus sustains eternal life.

Physical bread satisfies temporarily; Jesus satisfies permanently. Today we feed on the Bread of Life.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Bread of Life. Today we examine Jesus as the Way, Truth, and Life—the exclusive path to the Father.

"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). Not a way, but the way. Not a truth, but the truth.

In our pluralistic age, this sounds exclusive. It is. But it''s also inviting—the way is open to all who come. Today we embrace the exclusive and welcoming Christ.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Way, Truth, and Life. Today we examine Jesus as Resurrection and Life—victor over death.

"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die" (John 11:25). Jesus didn''t just teach about resurrection; He is resurrection.

Because He lives, we will live. Death is not the end for those in Christ. Today we trust the Resurrection and the Life.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Resurrection and Life. Today we examine Jesus as True Vine—our source of spiritual vitality.

"I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). Connection to Christ produces fruit.

Branches don''t strain to produce grapes; they simply stay connected. Likewise, our fruitfulness comes from abiding, not striving. Today we abide in the True Vine.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored True Vine. Today we examine Jesus as King of Kings—sovereign over all rulers.

"On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS" (Revelation 19:16). Every authority is under His authority.

Earthly kingdoms rise and fall; His kingdom is everlasting. Every knee will bow to Him. Today we submit to the King of Kings.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored King of Kings. Today we examine Jesus as Friend—remarkable intimacy with the Almighty.

"I no longer call you servants... Instead, I have called you friends" (John 15:15). Jesus doesn''t just tolerate us; He befriends us.

Friends share secrets; Jesus revealed what He received from the Father. Friends enjoy each other''s company; Jesus delights in us. Today we embrace the Friend who gave His life for us.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored Jesus'' names: Jesus, Christ, Lord, Lamb of God, Good Shepherd, Light of the World, Bread of Life, Way Truth Life, Resurrection and Life, True Vine, King of Kings, and Friend.

"At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth" (Philippians 2:10).

As you complete this study, which name of Jesus speaks to your heart? Call upon His name. He is everything His names declare—and infinitely more.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Peter''s restoration by Jesus. Today we see him at Pentecost—transformed from denier to bold proclaimer.

The same Peter who cowered before a servant girl now stood before thousands: "Let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah" (Acts 2:36). Three thousand believed.

What changed? The Holy Spirit. Peter''s courage wasn''t self-generated but Spirit-empowered. Today we see the transformation the Spirit produces in surrendered lives.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 witnessed Pentecost boldness. Today we see Peter healing and preaching at the temple—and facing the Sanhedrin.

Peter healed a lame man at the Beautiful Gate, then preached Christ to the gathered crowd. The authorities arrested him. Before the same council that condemned Jesus, Peter declared: "Salvation is found in no one else" (Acts 4:12).

They noted that Peter and John "had been with Jesus" (4:13). Time with Jesus produces boldness. Today we see courage that comes from communion with Christ.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw Peter before the Sanhedrin. Today we witness a pivotal moment: Peter''s vision at Joppa and the conversion of Cornelius.

Peter saw a sheet descending with unclean animals: "Kill and eat." Peter refused—he''d never eaten anything unclean. God replied: "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean" (Acts 10:15). Then messengers arrived from Cornelius, a Gentile.

Peter went, preached, and the Spirit fell on Gentiles. "Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water?" (10:47). The gospel broke ethnic barriers. Today we see Peter''s expanding understanding of God''s plan.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed Cornelius''s conversion. Today we see Peter imprisoned and miraculously delivered.

Herod arrested Peter, intending execution after Passover. The church prayed earnestly. An angel appeared, chains fell off, doors opened, and Peter walked free. He went to where believers were praying—and they didn''t believe their prayers were answered!

"Peter kept on knocking" (Acts 12:16). The answer stood at the door while they argued about whether it was really him. Today we see prayer answered beyond expectation.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 witnessed Peter''s deliverance. Today we see him at the Jerusalem Council—defending Gentile inclusion.

The question: Must Gentile converts be circumcised? Some said yes. Peter stood and recounted Cornelius''s conversion: "God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us" (Acts 15:8).

Peter''s testimony was crucial. The council decided Gentiles need not become Jews to become Christians. Today we see Peter using his experience to shape church doctrine.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw the Jerusalem Council. Today we confront a difficult moment: Peter''s hypocrisy at Antioch.

Peter ate with Gentiles until certain men came from James. Then he withdrew, fearing criticism. Paul opposed him publicly: "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile... How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?" (Galatians 2:14).

Even after Cornelius, Peter could still slip into old patterns. Spiritual growth isn''t linear. Today we see that even apostles needed correction—and could receive it.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 confronted Peter''s hypocrisy. Today we turn to his letters—Peter the pastor writing to suffering believers.

1 Peter addresses Christians facing persecution. Peter''s theme: suffering with hope. "In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials" (1 Peter 1:6).

Peter knew suffering—he''d face martyrdom. His letters aren''t theory but testimony. Today we hear the pastor who suffered teaching others how to suffer with hope.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 introduced Peter''s letters. Today we explore his teaching on submission—a counter-cultural call.

Peter instructed slaves to submit to masters, wives to husbands, and all to governing authorities. His rationale: Christ submitted to unjust suffering for our sake. "To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example" (1 Peter 2:21).

This isn''t endorsing injustice but teaching how to witness through endurance. Today we grapple with Peter''s challenging teaching on submission.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 examined submission. Today we explore 2 Peter''s warnings—false teachers and the coming judgment.

Peter''s second letter warns against false teachers who "will secretly introduce destructive heresies" (2 Peter 2:1). He describes their characteristics: greed, arrogance, and immorality.

He also addresses scoffers who mock Christ''s return: "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise... Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish" (3:9). Today we heed Peter''s warnings about deception and delay.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Peter: from fisherman to apostle, through failure and restoration, through boldness and hypocrisy, through pastoral care and prophetic warning.

Tradition says Peter was crucified upside down, feeling unworthy to die as Jesus did. The man who denied Christ three times died proclaiming Him.

As you complete this study, what has Peter''s life taught you? About failure and restoration? About growth that isn''t linear? About boldness from the Spirit? Peter''s journey encourages every stumbling disciple.'

-- ELIJAH & ELISHA 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Elijah''s restoration after despair. Today we see him confront Ahab again—over Naboth''s vineyard.

Naboth refused to sell his ancestral inheritance to King Ahab. Jezebel arranged false charges and had Naboth executed. Ahab went to claim the vineyard—and Elijah met him: "Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?... Dogs will lick your blood" (1 Kings 21:19).

Elijah''s courage returned. He confronted royal murder and theft without flinching. Today we see that God restores His servants for continued ministry.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw Naboth''s vineyard. Today we witness Elijah''s departure—taken to heaven in a whirlwind.

Elijah knew his time was near. Elisha refused to leave his side. They crossed the Jordan on dry ground. "A chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind" (2 Kings 2:11).

Elisha cried out, picked up Elijah''s cloak, and struck the Jordan—it parted. The prophetic mantle had transferred. Today we witness the dramatic end of one ministry and beginning of another.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw Elijah''s departure. Today we meet Elisha in ministry—performing his first miracles.

Elisha purified bad water at Jericho with salt. He pronounced judgment on mocking youths (a troubling passage, likely involving young men threatening a prophet). He provided water for armies in the wilderness.

The prophets recognized: "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha" (2 Kings 2:15). Elisha would perform twice as many miracles as Elijah. Today we see Elisha establishing his prophetic authority.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 introduced Elisha''s miracles. Today we witness one of his most personal: the Shunammite woman''s son.

A wealthy woman in Shunem provided hospitality for Elisha. He promised her a son. The child was born but later died. She rushed to Elisha. He came, prayed, and raised the boy from death.

This miracle of resurrection foreshadows Christ''s power over death. Today we see Elisha''s compassion and God''s power over the ultimate enemy.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 saw the Shunammite''s son raised. Today we witness Naaman''s healing—a proud general humbled.

Naaman, commander of Aram''s army, had leprosy. A captured Israelite servant girl suggested he visit Israel''s prophet. Elisha didn''t even meet him—just sent word: "Wash yourself seven times in the Jordan" (2 Kings 5:10).

Naaman was furious at the ordinary instruction. His servants reasoned with him; he obeyed; he was healed. "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel" (5:15). Today we see that God''s way often offends our pride.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw Naaman''s healing. Today we witness Elisha''s servant Gehazi''s failure—greed that brought leprosy.

After Naaman was healed, Elisha refused payment. But Gehazi chased Naaman and lied to obtain money and clothing. Elisha knew: "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot?" Naaman''s leprosy would cling to Gehazi (2 Kings 5:26-27).

Contrast: Naaman humbled and healed; Gehazi proud and leprous. Today we see the danger of using spiritual ministry for personal gain.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 saw Gehazi''s failure. Today we witness Elisha in military conflict—surrounded yet secure.

The king of Aram was frustrated: his battle plans kept being thwarted. He learned Elisha was revealing them to Israel. He sent an army to capture Elisha. Elisha''s servant panicked.

"Don''t be afraid... Those who are with us are more than those who are with them." Then Elisha prayed, and the servant saw: "the hills full of horses and chariots of fire" (2 Kings 6:16-17). Today we see unseen realities that change visible circumstances.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 revealed heavenly armies. Today we see Elisha during Samaria''s siege—prophesying abundance amid famine.

Samaria was besieged; people were starving, even eating children. Elisha prophesied: "About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel" (2 Kings 7:1). An officer scoffed.

God caused the Aramean army to hear sounds of a massive army and flee, abandoning supplies. The prophecy was fulfilled. The scoffing officer was trampled in the rush and didn''t eat the food he''d doubted would come. Today we see God''s abundance after desperate scarcity.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw siege relief. Today we witness Elisha''s final acts—prophetic power even in death.

Elisha fell ill. King Joash wept over him. Elisha instructed him to shoot an arrow (symbolizing victory over Aram), then strike the ground. Joash struck three times and stopped. Elisha was angry: "You should have struck the ground five or six times" (2 Kings 13:19). Limited obedience brought limited victory.

Even after death, when a body touched Elisha''s bones, the man revived. Today we see prophetic power that outlasted the prophet''s life.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Elijah and Elisha: confrontation and miracles, despair and restoration, departure and succession, compassion and judgment, war and peace.

"The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." The prophetic ministry continued through transition. God''s work is bigger than any one servant.

As you complete this study, what have these prophets taught you? About courage under pressure? About God''s provision and power? About succession and legacy? The same God who worked through them works through His servants today.'

-- MARRIAGE 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 addressed conflict in marriage. Today we explore intimacy—physical, emotional, and spiritual connection.

"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband" (1 Corinthians 7:3). Sexual intimacy in marriage is good, expected, and mutual. Neither spouse should deprive the other except by mutual consent for prayer.

But intimacy is more than physical. Emotional intimacy means knowing and being known. Spiritual intimacy means praying together, growing together, serving together. Today we explore the full dimensions of marital intimacy.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined intimacy. Today we address forgiveness in marriage—essential for long-term health.

Every marriage accumulates hurts. Without forgiveness, resentment builds walls. With forgiveness, offenses become opportunities for grace.

"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you" (Colossians 3:13). The standard: as Christ forgave us—completely. Today we explore making forgiveness a marriage habit.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored forgiveness. Today we examine seasons of marriage—it changes over time.

Newlywed passion differs from parenting exhaustion differs from empty-nest rediscovery differs from aging together. Each season has challenges and gifts.

Ecclesiastes says there''s "a time for everything" (3:1). Seasons change; commitment remains. The couple that navigates seasons together grows deeper than those who only enjoyed the easy times. Today we normalize marriage seasons and prepare for transitions.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed seasons. Today we explore serving each other—marriage as mutual ministry.

"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Ephesians 5:21). Before specific instructions to wives and husbands, Paul calls for mutual submission. Marriage is mutual service.

Jesus washed feet; we serve spouses. What does your spouse need? How can you serve today? Marriage thrives when both partners ask "How can I serve?" rather than "What do I get?" Today we cultivate servant hearts.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined serving. Today we address protecting marriage—it faces real threats.

Threats include: neglect (taking each other for granted), outside attractions (emotional or physical), busyness (no time for each other), conflict avoidance (issues fester), and in-law interference.

"Above all else, guard your heart" (Proverbs 4:23). Guarding marriage means: maintaining boundaries, prioritizing time together, addressing issues early, and keeping the marriage bed honored. Today we identify and address threats.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 examined protecting marriage. Today we explore praying together—spiritual partnership.

Couples who pray together report stronger marriages. Yet many Christian couples rarely pray together. Why? It''s vulnerable. It requires time. It feels awkward.

Peter warned husbands to treat wives well "so that nothing will hinder your prayers" (1 Peter 3:7). Marriage and prayer are connected. Today we commit to praying with and for our spouses.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored praying together. Today we address difficult seasons—when marriage is hard.

Every marriage has hard seasons: financial stress, health crises, parenting struggles, job loss, grief, or simply growing apart. What then?

"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" (1 Corinthians 13:7). Love endures difficulty. It doesn''t quit when quitting seems easier. Today we prepare for (or navigate) marriage''s hard seasons.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed hard seasons. Today we explore growing together—becoming better together than apart.

Healthy marriages make both partners better. "Two are better than one" (Ecclesiastes 4:9). You sharpen each other, encourage each other, complement each other''s weaknesses.

Growing together requires: shared goals, mutual encouragement, honest feedback, and celebrating each other''s growth. Today we ask: Are we growing together or growing apart?',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored growing together. Today we examine leaving a legacy—what your marriage passes on.

Your marriage teaches children (if you have them) what marriage looks like. It witnesses to a watching world. It either commends or undermines the gospel picture marriage represents.

"Grandchildren are the crown of the aged" (Proverbs 17:6). Legacy extends beyond your lifetime. What legacy is your marriage building? Today we consider multi-generational impact.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored marriage: God''s design, roles, communication, conflict, intimacy, forgiveness, seasons, service, protection, prayer, hard times, growth, and legacy.

"This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32). Marriage points to greater reality.

As you complete this study, what will you do differently? What conversations need to happen? What habits need changing? Invest in your marriage—it''s worth the effort and it pictures the gospel.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored discipline. Today we examine instruction—teaching children God''s Word and ways.

"These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road" (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). Teaching is woven through daily life.

This requires: knowing truth ourselves (it must be on our hearts first), intentional teaching moments, and natural conversation about faith. Today we develop strategies for faith instruction.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined instruction. Today we address modeling—children learn more from watching than hearing.

"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" (1 Corinthians 11:1). Paul could say this; can we? Children absorb what they see.

If we want praying children, they must see us pray. If we want generous children, they must see us give. If we want honest children, they must hear us tell truth. Today we examine what our lives are teaching our children.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored modeling. Today we examine different ages—parenting changes as children grow.

Toddlers need different parenting than teenagers. Young children need more control; older children need more coaching; young adults need friendship.

"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child" (1 Corinthians 13:11). Children aren''t mini-adults. Age-appropriate expectations and approaches matter. Today we adapt parenting to developmental stages.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed developmental stages. Today we examine protecting children—spiritual, emotional, and physical safety.

"If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned" (Matthew 18:6). Jesus takes child protection seriously.

Protection includes: guarding what enters their minds (media, relationships), creating safe home environments, teaching them to recognize danger, and being available when they need help. Today we assess our protective practices.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored protection. Today we address releasing children—the goal is launch, not permanent dependence.

"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife" (Genesis 2:24). Leaving is the goal. We raise children to leave well.

This requires progressively releasing control, allowing age-appropriate decisions and consequences, and preparing them for independence. Holding on too tightly prevents healthy development. Today we examine whether we''re preparing children for launch.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 addressed releasing. Today we explore praying for children—our most important parenting practice.

Job "would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, ''Perhaps my children have sinned''... This was Job''s regular custom" (Job 1:5). Job covered his children in prayer regularly.

We can''t control our children''s choices, but we can pray for them. Prayer invites God''s work in their lives. Today we develop consistent prayer practices for our children.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 examined praying for children. Today we address prodigals—when children wander from faith.

The prodigal son wandered, but the father never stopped watching, never stopped hoping, and ran to embrace his returning son. Some children wander despite faithful parenting.

If your child wanders: keep praying, keep the door open, maintain relationship without enabling sin, and trust God''s pursuing love. The story isn''t over until it''s over. Today we find hope for wandering children.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed prodigals. Today we examine single parenting—unique challenges and God''s sufficiency.

Single parents carry double loads. It''s exhausting. But God is "a father to the fatherless" (Psalm 68:5). He promises to help the vulnerable.

Practical helps: accept assistance from church family, prioritize what matters most, release guilt about what you can''t do, and trust God to fill gaps. Today we honor single parents and explore resources for their journey.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 addressed single parenting. Today we explore blended families—unique complexities and opportunities.

Blended families face challenges: loyalty conflicts, step-parent authority, different family cultures, and complicated logistics. These are real and difficult.

Wisdom includes: patience (blending takes time), realistic expectations, honoring biological parents, building new traditions, and prioritizing the marriage at the center. Today we navigate blended family dynamics.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored parenting: stewardship, faith transmission, discipline, instruction, modeling, developmental stages, protection, releasing, prayer, prodigals, single parenting, and blended families.

"Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him" (Psalm 127:3). They''re gifts—challenging, delightful, exhausting gifts.

As you complete this study, what has encouraged you? What changes will you make? Parenting is hard; God''s grace is sufficient. Raise your children for His glory.'

-- GRIEF AND COMFORT 14 DAYS
-- ============================================
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the ministry of presence. Today we examine types of grief—it comes in many forms.

Grief includes: death of loved ones, divorce, job loss, health decline, miscarriage, broken relationships, unfulfilled dreams, and life transitions. Each loss deserves acknowledgment.

"There is a time for everything... a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance" (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 4). Grief is appropriate response to loss. Today we validate the many forms grief takes.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored types of grief. Today we address grief''s stages—the path through mourning.

Common stages include: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. These aren''t linear—people cycle through them differently.

Understanding stages helps normalize the experience. Feeling angry doesn''t mean faithless. Bargaining is natural. Depression is expected. Today we recognize where we are in grief''s journey without rushing the process.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored grief''s stages. Today we examine how not to grieve—"as others do who have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13).

Christian grief differs from hopeless grief. We mourn, but not without hope. We weep, but with resurrection confidence. We feel loss, but not permanent separation from those in Christ.

"If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him" (1 Thessalonians 4:14). Hope transforms grief. Today we grieve with hope.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored hopeful grief. Today we address when grief becomes complicated—sometimes professional help is needed.

Grief that doesn''t progress, that completely disrupts functioning for extended periods, or that leads to self-harm needs professional attention. This isn''t weakness; it''s wisdom.

"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" (Proverbs 15:22). Counselors, pastors, and grief support groups can help. Today we normalize seeking help for complicated grief.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed complicated grief. Today we explore comfort from Scripture—specific passages for grieving hearts.

Psalm 23: "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me." Psalm 34:18: "The LORD is close to the brokenhearted." John 14:1-3: "I go to prepare a place for you." Revelation 21:4: "He will wipe every tear."

Scripture provides words when we have none, hope when we see none, and presence when we feel alone. Today we meditate on comforting passages.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Scripture comfort. Today we examine comfort from community—we need each other.

"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).

Community provides: presence (just being there), practical help (meals, errands), listening ears (letting us talk), and shared tears. Today we receive and give community comfort.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored community comfort. Today we address the question "Why?"—it''s natural but often unanswered.

Job asked why; God answered with His presence, not explanations. Sometimes we won''t understand. "Now I know in part; then I shall know fully" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Complete understanding awaits heaven.

What we do know: God is good, God is sovereign, and God is with us. We can trust His character when we can''t trace His ways. Today we accept mystery while trusting the Mysterious One.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed the "why" question. Today we explore continuing bonds—honoring the deceased while moving forward.

Grief doesn''t mean forgetting. We can honor memories, tell stories, and maintain appropriate connections while also moving forward. The goal isn''t "getting over" but "living with."

Healthy continuing bonds include: celebrating anniversaries appropriately, keeping meaningful mementos, sharing memories, and allowing the deceased''s positive influence to continue. Today we explore healthy continuing bonds.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored continuing bonds. Today we examine helping grieving children—they process differently.

Children grieve according to developmental understanding. Young children may not grasp permanence. Teenagers may mask grief or act out. All need honest, age-appropriate information and permission to feel.

"Let the little children come to me" (Mark 10:14). Jesus welcomed children; we should comfort them. Today we explore helping children through grief.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored grief: God as comforter, lament, presence ministry, types and stages, hopeful grieving, complicated grief, Scripture and community comfort, unanswered questions, continuing bonds, and grieving children.

"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted" (Matthew 5:4). Mourning opens us to divine comfort.

As you complete this study, where are you in the grief journey? What comfort have you received? What comfort can you give? God is near to the brokenhearted—draw near to Him.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored vision. Today we examine communication—leaders must convey vision compellingly.

Nehemiah communicated the vision for rebuilding Jerusalem''s walls clearly: "You see the trouble we are in... Come, let us rebuild." The people responded: "Let us start rebuilding" (Nehemiah 2:17-18). Clear communication produced unified action.

Good communication includes: clarity (people understand), inspiration (people want to participate), and repetition (people remember). Today we develop communication skills for leadership.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined communication. Today we explore decision-making—leaders face constant choices.

Moses was advised by Jethro to delegate decisions: handle only the difficult cases personally (Exodus 18:22). Wise leaders know what to decide and what to delegate.

Decision-making wisdom includes: gathering information, seeking counsel, considering consequences, praying for wisdom, and acting decisively. Indecision is itself a decision. Today we develop decision-making processes.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored decision-making. Today we examine handling criticism—it comes with leadership territory.

Moses faced constant criticism. David was mocked by Michal. Jesus was called a drunkard and demon-possessed. Leaders attract criticism.

Wisdom includes: listening for legitimate concerns, ignoring unfounded attacks, maintaining focus on mission, and not taking everything personally. "A gentle answer turns away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). Today we develop resilience for criticism.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed criticism. Today we explore developing others—leaders multiply themselves.

Jesus spent three years developing twelve disciples. Paul invested in Timothy, Titus, and others. Good leaders develop future leaders.

"The things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Four generations in one verse. Today we commit to developing others.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined developing others. Today we address leading through change—it''s always challenging.

Nehemiah led change against opposition. Jesus brought radical change to religious assumptions. Change produces resistance; leaders must navigate it.

Change leadership includes: communicating why change is necessary, involving people in the process, addressing concerns honestly, and maintaining patience. Today we develop change leadership skills.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored leading change. Today we examine leading yourself—you can''t lead others well if you''re not leading yourself.

Paul wrote: "I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified" (1 Corinthians 9:27). Self-leadership precedes public leadership.

Self-leadership includes: managing time, maintaining disciplines, guarding heart, developing continuously, and resting appropriately. Today we assess our self-leadership.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored self-leadership. Today we address leading in crisis—when everything goes wrong.

Nehemiah faced crisis: enemies threatened, workers despaired, resources ran low. His response: "Don''t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight" (Nehemiah 4:14). Prayer and action.

Crisis leadership requires: staying calm, communicating clearly, making decisions, and maintaining hope. Today we prepare for (or navigate) leadership in crisis.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 addressed crisis leadership. Today we examine leading a team—you can''t accomplish much alone.

Jesus chose twelve. Nehemiah organized workers by family groups. Paul traveled with teams. Teams accomplish more than individuals.

Team leadership includes: choosing the right people, clarifying roles, empowering action, resolving conflict, and celebrating wins. Today we develop team leadership skills.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored team leadership. Today we address succession—good leaders prepare their replacement.

Moses invested in Joshua. Elijah mentored Elisha. Paul developed Timothy. Leaders who don''t plan succession leave vacuums.

"Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18 KJV). Vision dies without succession. Who are you developing? What would happen if you left? Today we plan for succession.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored leadership: servant leadership, character, vision, communication, decisions, criticism, developing others, change, self-leadership, crisis, teams, and succession.

"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant" (Matthew 20:26). Jesus redefined greatness.

As you complete this study, what leadership growth do you need? What practices will you implement? Lead as Jesus led—with character, service, and vision.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 discussed spiritual disciplines. Today we examine the Church—you''re not meant to follow Jesus alone.

"Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing" (Hebrews 10:25). God places believers in community. The "one anothers" of Scripture require one anothers.

The church isn''t a building but a body—believers gathered for worship, teaching, fellowship, and mission. Finding and committing to a local church is essential for growth. Today we explore the importance of church.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored the Church. Today we examine baptism—the public declaration of faith.

"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins" (Acts 2:38). Baptism publicly identifies us with Christ''s death, burial, and resurrection.

Baptism doesn''t save (the thief on the cross wasn''t baptized), but it''s commanded for believers. It''s a starting point, an identification, and a testimony. Today we understand baptism''s significance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored baptism. Today we examine communion (the Lord''s Supper)—remembering Christ''s sacrifice.

"Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Jesus gave His followers a regular practice: bread representing His body, wine (or juice) representing His blood, taken together in remembrance.

Communion isn''t magic but memorial. It''s the church gathered around the table, remembering the cross, proclaiming His death until He comes (1 Corinthians 11:26). Today we understand communion''s meaning.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored communion. Today we examine dealing with sin—what happens when believers sin.

Christians still sin. "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves" (1 John 1:8). What then?

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). Confession brings forgiveness. We don''t lose our salvation, but we restore fellowship. Today we learn to deal with ongoing sin.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored dealing with sin. Today we examine the reality of spiritual battle—we have an enemy.

"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour" (1 Peter 5:8). Satan is real and active.

But "the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). We resist by submission to God, using Scripture, prayer, and the armor of God. Today we acknowledge spiritual warfare.',

"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect" (1 Peter 3:15). We''re witnesses of what we''ve experienced.

Sharing faith starts with living differently, then being ready to explain. Today we prepare to share our faith naturally.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored sharing faith. Today we examine giving—stewardship of God''s resources.

"Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Corinthians 9:7). Giving expresses trust and worship.

Everything belongs to God; we''re stewards. The tithe (10%) is a biblical starting point; generosity goes beyond. Today we develop a giving practice.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored giving. Today we examine suffering—why do bad things happen to believers?

Jesus promised: "In this world you will have trouble" (John 16:33). Christians aren''t exempt from suffering. But "take heart! I have overcome the world."

Suffering can refine faith, produce character, deepen dependence, and qualify us to comfort others (2 Corinthians 1:4). Today we develop a biblical perspective on suffering.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored suffering. Today we examine heaven—our certain hope.

"My Father''s house has many rooms... I am going there to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2). Heaven is real. Jesus is preparing it. We will be there.

Heaven is being with Christ forever, in resurrected bodies, in renewed creation, free from sin and suffering. This hope transforms present living. Today we anticipate our eternal home.',

Adonai emphasizes God''s authority and our submission. When we call Him "Lord," we acknowledge His right to command and our obligation to obey.

"Why do you call me, ''Lord, Lord,'' and do not do what I say?" (Luke 6:46). Adonai isn''t just a title; it''s a relationship of obedience. Today we submit to Adonai.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored Adonai. Today we examine Yahweh Jireh—The LORD Who Provides.

When Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, God provided a ram. "Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide" (Genesis 22:14). The provider anticipated need before Abraham knew it existed.

Whatever you face, Yahweh Jireh has already seen it and prepared provision. Today we trust the Provider.',

"I am the LORD, who heals you" (Exodus 15:26). God is the source of healing—physical, emotional, spiritual. He healed in Scripture; He heals today.

Healing doesn''t always come when or how we expect. But we can always pray to the Healer and trust His wisdom. Today we bring our wounds to Yahweh Rapha.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Yahweh Rapha. Today we examine Yahweh Nissi—The LORD Is My Banner.

After defeating the Amalekites, Moses built an altar and named it Yahweh Nissi (Exodus 17:15). A banner was a rallying point in battle. God was their victory.

When life is battle, Yahweh Nissi is our rallying point. He leads us to victory. Today we fight under His banner.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Yahweh Nissi. Today we examine Yahweh Shalom—The LORD Is Peace.

Gideon built an altar after encountering God: "The LORD is Peace" (Judges 6:24). In anxious times, God gives peace beyond circumstances.

"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you" (John 14:27). Jesus extended the peace Yahweh always offered. Today we receive peace from Yahweh Shalom.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Yahweh Shalom. Today we examine Yahweh Rohi—The LORD Is My Shepherd.

"The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing" (Psalm 23:1). The shepherd provides, protects, guides, and cares for sheep who would otherwise be helpless.

Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep" (John 10:11). Yahweh Rohi gave His life for us. Today we follow our Shepherd.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Yahweh Rohi. Today we examine Yahweh Tsidkenu—The LORD Our Righteousness.

"This is the name by which he will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness" (Jeremiah 23:6). We can''t be righteous enough; He becomes our righteousness.

"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:21). Today we rest in Yahweh Tsidkenu—our righteousness comes from Him.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored Yahweh Tsidkenu. Today we examine Yahweh Shammah—The LORD Is There.

Ezekiel''s vision of the new Jerusalem concludes: "The name of the city from that time on will be: THE LORD IS THERE" (Ezekiel 48:35). God''s presence defines His people''s home.

"Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5). Wherever you go, Yahweh Shammah is there. Today we practice His presence.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored Yahweh Shammah. Today we examine Father—the New Testament revelation of intimate relationship.

Jesus introduced God as "Abba, Father" (Mark 14:36)—an intimate term, like "Dad" or "Papa." The holy God of the universe invites us into family.

"The Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, ''Abba, Father''" (Romans 8:15). Today we approach God as our Father.',

Every Old Testament lamb pointed forward to Him. He is the Passover Lamb whose blood protects us from judgment. Today we worship the Lamb who was slain.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored Lamb of God. Today we examine Jesus as Good Shepherd—the one who cares for His sheep.

"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep" (John 10:11). Unlike hired hands who abandon sheep in danger, Jesus died for His.

He knows His sheep by name (10:3), leads them to good pasture, and protects them from wolves. Today we follow the Good Shepherd.',

"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:12). In a world of confusion, He provides clarity.

Light exposes, guides, and enables life. Jesus does all three. Today we walk in His light.',

"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty" (John 6:35). Bread sustains life; Jesus sustains eternal life.

Physical bread satisfies temporarily; Jesus satisfies permanently. Today we feed on the Bread of Life.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Bread of Life. Today we examine Jesus as the Way, Truth, and Life—the exclusive path to the Father.

"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). Not a way, but the way. Not a truth, but the truth.

In our pluralistic age, this sounds exclusive. It is. But it''s also inviting—the way is open to all who come. Today we embrace the exclusive and welcoming Christ.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Way, Truth, and Life. Today we examine Jesus as Resurrection and Life—victor over death.

"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die" (John 11:25). Jesus didn''t just teach about resurrection; He is resurrection.

Because He lives, we will live. Death is not the end for those in Christ. Today we trust the Resurrection and the Life.',

"I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). Connection to Christ produces fruit.

Branches don''t strain to produce grapes; they simply stay connected. Likewise, our fruitfulness comes from abiding, not striving. Today we abide in the True Vine.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored True Vine. Today we examine Jesus as King of Kings—sovereign over all rulers.

"On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS" (Revelation 19:16). Every authority is under His authority.

Earthly kingdoms rise and fall; His kingdom is everlasting. Every knee will bow to Him. Today we submit to the King of Kings.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored King of Kings. Today we examine Jesus as Friend—remarkable intimacy with the Almighty.

"I no longer call you servants... Instead, I have called you friends" (John 15:15). Jesus doesn''t just tolerate us; He befriends us.

Friends share secrets; Jesus revealed what He received from the Father. Friends enjoy each other''s company; Jesus delights in us. Today we embrace the Friend who gave His life for us.',

"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God" (Romans 5:1). Peace replaces hostility. We''re no longer enemies but reconciled.

Through Adam, sin and death entered. Through Christ, grace and life abound. "Where sin increased, grace increased all the more" (5:20). Today we rejoice in justification''s benefits.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored justification''s benefits. Today we examine Romans 6—dead to sin, alive to God.

"Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus" (Romans 6:11). We''re not just forgiven; we''re transformed. The old self was crucified; we walk in newness of life.

This isn''t automatic—we must "count" or "reckon" it true. Today we appropriate our death to sin and life to God.',

"I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing" (Romans 7:19). Paul articulates the frustrating struggle every believer knows.

This isn''t defeat but honesty. We''re saved, but sin still dwells in our members. The struggle is real—but so is victory. Today we face the tension honestly.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored the struggle. Today we reach Romans 8—perhaps Scripture''s greatest chapter.

"There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1). Chapter 8 answers chapter 7''s struggle: Spirit-empowered living brings freedom.

The Spirit gives life, bears witness to our adoption, helps our weakness, and guarantees our glorification. Nothing can separate us from God''s love. Today we soar in Romans 8.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 soared in Romans 8. Today we enter Romans 9-11—God''s plan for Israel.

These chapters address a difficult question: Has God''s word failed if Israel rejected their Messiah? Paul answers: God''s sovereignty is complete, Israel''s rejection opened the door for Gentiles, and all Israel will be saved.

"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" (11:33). Today we explore God''s mysterious but trustworthy plan.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored God''s plan for Israel. Today we begin Romans 12—living sacrifices.

"Offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship" (Romans 12:1). Theology becomes life. What we believe changes how we live.

The "therefore" of 12:1 connects to chapters 1-11: because of all God has done, this is our response. Today we present ourselves as living sacrifices.',

"In Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others" (Romans 12:5). Different gifts, unified body. Prophecy, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, showing mercy—all needed.

The chapter concludes with instructions for community: genuine love, honoring others, sharing with the needy, living in peace. Today we function as body members.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored body functioning. Today we examine Romans 13—submission to authorities.

"Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established" (Romans 13:1). This verse has challenged Christians under unjust governments.

Paul''s point: Christians should be exemplary citizens, not rebels. We submit except when commands contradict God''s commands (Acts 5:29). Today we navigate submission and conscience.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored submission to authorities. Today we examine Romans 14-15—the weak and the strong.

"Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters" (Romans 14:1). Christians disagree on secondary issues. How do we handle this?

Don''t judge those who differ. Don''t cause others to stumble. "Each of us will give an account of ourselves to God" (14:12). Today we learn Christian tolerance on non-essentials.',

In Pisidian Antioch, Paul preached in the synagogue. Initial response was enthusiastic; nearly the whole city gathered. But jealous Jews opposed him. Paul declared: "We now turn to the Gentiles" (Acts 13:46).

This pattern repeats: offer to Jews first, rejection by some, turning to Gentiles. Today we see the gospel crossing boundaries.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw the Gentile turn. Today we witness the Jerusalem Council—the first major church controversy resolved.

Must Gentile converts be circumcised? Some said yes. Paul and Barnabas were sent to Jerusalem. After discussion, Peter testified, Paul and Barnabas reported, and James concluded: "We should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God" (Acts 15:19).

Minimal requirements were sent. Today we see the church navigating theological conflict.',

Paul wanted to revisit churches; Barnabas wanted to bring John Mark (who had deserted them before). "They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company" (Acts 15:39). Even apostles disagreed.

The result: two missionary teams instead of one. God used even their conflict. Today we see that human weakness doesn''t stop God''s work.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw the second journey begin. Today we witness Paul in Philippi—jail becoming gospel opportunity.

Paul and Silas were beaten and imprisoned for freeing a slave girl from a demon. At midnight, they sang hymns. An earthquake opened doors. The jailer nearly killed himself but Paul stopped him.

"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household" (Acts 16:31). The jailer believed and was baptized. Today we see the gospel advancing through suffering.',

Paul was "greatly distressed" by Athens'' idols. At the Areopagus, he engaged their culture: "I found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you" (Acts 17:23).

Some sneered; some believed. Today we learn to engage culture with wisdom.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 witnessed Athens. Today we see Paul in Corinth—staying longer, establishing church.

Paul stayed 18 months in Corinth, working as tentmaker, preaching in the synagogue, then focusing on Gentiles. The Lord encouraged him in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you" (Acts 18:9-10).

Today we see extended ministry establishing a church that would need Paul''s ongoing attention.',

Paul spent over two years in Ephesus. "All the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord" (Acts 19:10). Ephesus became a hub for regional evangelism.

A riot erupted when the gospel threatened idol-making businesses. Today we see the gospel''s cultural and economic impact.',

Paul told the elders: "I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there... I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me" (Acts 20:22-23).

He charged them to shepherd the church and warned of coming wolves. Today we hear a leader''s poignant farewell.',

Paul was seized in the temple, falsely accused, arrested by Romans. He addressed the crowd, testified before the Sanhedrin, survived plots, appealed to Caesar. Custody became platform.

"Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome" (Acts 23:11). Today we see God''s plan advancing through arrest.',

Deborah judged Israel, settling disputes under her palm tree. When Barak hesitated to fight without her, she accompanied him. Her leadership helped deliver Israel from Canaanite oppression.

"Village life in Israel ceased... until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel" (Judges 5:7). Today we see a woman raised by God to lead His people.',

Esther became queen of Persia without revealing her Jewish identity. When Haman plotted genocide against the Jews, Esther had to choose: remain silent and safe, or speak and risk death.

"Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you" (Luke 1:28). Mary was chosen for the extraordinary role of bearing the Son of God. Her response: "I am the Lord''s servant... May your word to me be fulfilled" (1:38).

Mary pondered mysteries in her heart, watched her son die, and witnessed His resurrection. Today we learn from her faithful surrender.',

Mary Magdalene was freed from seven demons. She followed Jesus, supported His ministry, stood at the cross when others fled, and was first to the empty tomb.

Jesus chose her to be the first witness of His resurrection. "Go to my brothers and tell them" (John 20:17). Today we see devoted discipleship.',

Martha prepared; Mary listened. Jesus commended Mary''s choice. But later, Martha declared: "I believe that you are the Messiah" (John 11:27)—one of the clearest confessions in Scripture.

Both sisters loved Jesus; both are commended. Today we see that different expressions of devotion can both honor Christ.',

Priscilla (with Aquila) hosted churches, traveled with Paul, and accurately taught Apollos "the way of God more adequately" (Acts 18:26). She''s often named first—suggesting her prominence.

Before printing, Scripture was copied by hand. Scribes were meticulous—counting letters, checking margins, using multiple review processes. The Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BC - 70 AD) confirm remarkable accuracy of transmission.

"The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever" (Isaiah 40:8). Today we trace how God''s word was preserved through history.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined transmission. Today we explore translation—making Scripture accessible to all.

Jerome''s Vulgate (Latin), early translations into Syriac, Coptic, and Gothic, and Wycliffe''s English translation all sought to bring Scripture to people in their language.

"Faith comes from hearing the message" (Romans 10:17). Translation enables hearing. Today we appreciate those who made Scripture accessible.',

Luther translated the Bible into German. Tyndale died to bring English Scripture. "Lord, open the King of England''s eyes!" Tyndale prayed at his execution. Within years, the English Bible was authorized.

The printing press multiplied Scripture distribution. Today we trace the Reformation''s impact on Bible access.',

The 1611 KJV became the dominant English translation for centuries. Its beautiful language shaped English literature and worship. Subsequent translations—RV, ASV, RSV—sought accuracy updates.

"Every word of God is flawless" (Proverbs 30:5). Translation aims to faithfully render flawless words. Today we appreciate the KJV legacy.',

Translation involves choices: word-for-word (formal equivalence) or thought-for-thought (dynamic equivalence)? NASB emphasizes the former; NIV balances both; NLT emphasizes the latter.

Different translations serve different purposes. Today we understand translation philosophy and choose translations wisely.',

Archaeological discoveries have repeatedly confirmed Scripture: the Hittites existed (once doubted), Belshazzar ruled (once questioned), and David existed (confirmed by the Tel Dan inscription).

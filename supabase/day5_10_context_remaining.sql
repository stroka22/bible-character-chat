-- FORGIVENESS IN RELATIONSHIPS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the ongoing process after forgiveness. Today we examine preventing bitterness—stopping unforgiveness before it takes root.

"See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many" (Hebrews 12:15). Bitterness spreads like weeds—once rooted, it''s hard to remove.

Prevention requires: processing offenses promptly, expressing hurt appropriately, choosing forgiveness before resentment builds, and maintaining short accounts. Today we examine our hearts for any bitter roots beginning to grow.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed preventing bitterness. Today we explore forgiveness and trust—they''re related but different.

Forgiveness is given; trust is earned. You can forgive someone without trusting them with the same access they had before. "Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). Wisdom maintains appropriate boundaries.

Rebuilding trust requires consistent behavior over time. The offender must demonstrate change; the offended decides when (and if) to extend renewed trust. Today we navigate this distinction wisely.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 distinguished forgiveness from trust. Today we address what to do when the other person doesn''t acknowledge wrong.

Some people never apologize. Can we still forgive? Yes—forgiveness is our release of the debt to God, regardless of the offender''s response. We don''t need their acknowledgment to find freedom.

Jesus forgave from the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). His executioners didn''t apologize. We can release even when acknowledgment never comes. Today we forgive the unrepentant.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed forgiving the unrepentant. Today we explore forgiveness in marriage—where offenses are frequent and stakes are high.

"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you" (Ephesians 4:32). Marriage requires constant forgiveness—not because spouses are terrible but because intimacy means frequent opportunity for offense.

Keep short accounts, address issues promptly, assume positive intent when possible, and remember you need forgiveness too. Marriage thrives on mutual grace. Today we cultivate forgiveness cultures in our closest relationships.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed marriage. Today we examine generational forgiveness—releasing offenses against family members, even parents.

Some carry wounds from childhood that shape adult struggles. Forgiving parents who failed—whether through abuse, neglect, or simple imperfection—is difficult but necessary.

Honoring parents (fifth commandment) doesn''t mean pretending they were perfect. It means treating them with respect while honestly acknowledging harm. Forgiveness doesn''t require pretending—it requires releasing. Today we consider whether generational wounds need addressing.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored forgiveness in relationships from multiple angles: prevention, trust, unrepentant offenders, marriage, and generational wounds. Today we commit to being forgiving people.

"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you" (Colossians 3:13). The measure is how the Lord forgave us—completely.

As you complete this study, what relationships need forgiveness applied? What conversations need to happen? What freedom awaits when you release? Be a forgiving person—it''s who you are in Christ.'
WHERE slug = 'forgiveness-relationships';

-- POWER OF COMMUNITY
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined community''s power for mission. Today we explore vulnerability—the key that unlocks deep community.

"Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed" (James 5:16). Genuine community requires honesty about struggles, not just presentation of our best selves.

Vulnerability is risky—people might reject us. But without it, relationships remain superficial. We know about each other without truly knowing each other. Today we consider: Where do you need to be more vulnerable? Who has earned that trust?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored vulnerability. Today we address receiving help—many Christians are better at giving than receiving.

"Carry each other''s burdens" (Galatians 6:2) requires people willing to have their burdens carried. Pride often prevents us from admitting need. We want to be helpers, not helped.

Yet receiving blesses the giver. When we refuse help, we rob others of the joy of serving. Humility receives graciously. Today we examine: Do you let others help? Do you admit when you''re struggling?',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed receiving help. Today we explore conflict in community—it''s inevitable and can be constructive.

"If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault" (Matthew 18:15). Community close enough to matter will have conflict. The question isn''t whether but how we handle it.

Healthy conflict: addresses issues directly, assumes positive intent, seeks understanding, speaks truth in love, and pursues resolution. Unhealthy conflict: avoids, gossips, assumes worst, attacks persons rather than issues, and gives up. Today we prepare for redemptive conflict.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed conflict. Today we examine seasons of community—not every relationship is forever, and that''s okay.

Paul and Barnabas parted ways over John Mark (Acts 15:39). It was sharp disagreement, yet both continued effective ministry. Some relationships serve seasons, then transition.

This doesn''t mean we abandon people casually. But it does mean we hold even good relationships with open hands. New seasons bring new community. Today we recognize that some relationships changing doesn''t mean failure.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed seasons. Today we explore digital community—its possibilities and limitations in our connected age.

Online connections can encourage, teach, and support. Believers across the globe can pray together. Digital tools extend community''s reach.

But digital community has limits: no physical presence, limited accountability, easy exit when hard. It supplements but shouldn''t replace embodied community. "Let us not give up meeting together" (Hebrews 10:25) points to physical gathering. Today we evaluate our community balance.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored community''s basis, protection, mission, vulnerability, receiving help, conflict, seasons, and digital dimensions. Today we commit to deep community.

"They devoted themselves to the apostles'' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer" (Acts 2:42). Devotion to fellowship characterized the early church.

As you complete this study, what community commitments will you make? Who will you pursue deeper relationship with? How will you engage more fully? You weren''t meant to do this alone—and you don''t have to.'
WHERE slug = 'power-of-community';

-- SHARING YOUR FAITH
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 developed your personal testimony. Today we explore asking good questions—curiosity that opens doors.

Jesus often asked questions: "What do you want me to do for you?" "Who do people say I am?" "Do you want to get well?" Questions engage people where they are and reveal their hearts.

Good questions in faith conversations: "What do you think about that?" "Have you ever considered...?" "What shaped your view?" "Can I share what I''ve experienced?" Questions invite dialogue; lectures close it. Today we practice conversational evangelism.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored asking questions. Today we address objections—what to do when people push back.

Common objections: "How can a good God allow suffering?" "What about those who''ve never heard?" "Aren''t all religions basically the same?" Don''t panic. You don''t need all answers—you need honest engagement.

Some responses: "That''s a great question—I''ve wondered that too." "I don''t have all the answers, but here''s what I''ve come to understand." "Can I think about that and get back to you?" Honesty builds credibility. Today we prepare for common objections.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed objections. Today we explore lifestyle evangelism—living in ways that prompt questions.

"Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God" (1 Peter 2:12). Our lives should raise questions that create opportunities for answers.

What makes people ask? Unusual peace in crisis, unexplained joy, countercultural generosity, integrity when no one''s watching, and hope that doesn''t make sense. Today we examine whether our lives prompt spiritual curiosity.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored lifestyle evangelism. Today we address fear—the number one barrier to sharing faith.

Fear of rejection, fear of not knowing what to say, fear of damaging relationships, fear of being seen as weird. These fears are normal. They don''t disqualify you—they make you human.

"For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline" (2 Timothy 1:7). We move forward despite fear, trusting the Spirit. Today we name our fears and face them.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed fear. Today we examine relying on the Spirit—evangelism isn''t solo work.

"When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth" (John 16:13). The Spirit convicts hearts—we can''t convince anyone of spiritual truth apart from His work. This is freeing: the outcome doesn''t depend on our eloquence.

Our job: be faithful. The Spirit''s job: work in hearts. Pray before conversations, invite the Spirit''s leading during them, and trust Him with results. Today we shift from pressure to partnership.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored the gospel message, natural conversations, personal testimony, questions, objections, lifestyle, fear, and Spirit-reliance. Today we commit to sharing.

"How can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" (Romans 10:14). People need to hear—and we''re the ones to tell them.

As you complete this study, who needs to hear your story? What opportunities are you avoiding? The gospel changed your life—share that life with others.'
WHERE slug = 'sharing-your-faith';

-- OBEDIENCE OVER COMFORT
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined trusting God''s character when obedience doesn''t make sense. Today we explore the process: how do we actually choose obedience when comfort beckons?

The process often involves: recognizing the choice (this is a decision point), remembering truth (what does God say?), counting the cost of both options, deciding to obey, taking the first step, and persevering through discomfort.

"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11). Scripture memorized provides ammunition in decision moments. Today we practice the obedience decision process.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored the obedience process. Today we address comfort''s deception—it promises more than it delivers.

Comfort seems safe but often isn''t. Avoiding hard conversations feels comfortable but erodes relationships. Staying in unfulfilling work feels safe but wastes potential. Refusing to share faith feels easier but abandons mission.

"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death" (Proverbs 14:12). Short-term comfort often produces long-term regret. Today we examine where comfort is deceiving us.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 exposed comfort''s deception. Today we explore the fruit of difficult obedience—what we gain by choosing hard paths.

Abraham obeyed regarding Isaac and received God''s deepest blessing. Moses faced Pharaoh and led a nation to freedom. The disciples left everything and changed history. Hard obedience leads to abundant life.

"Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it" (Matthew 16:25). The paradox: safety through surrender, life through death. Today we envision what obedience might produce.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined obedience''s fruit. Today we address small obediences—big faithfulness starts small.

"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much" (Luke 16:10). Grand obedience is built on daily faithfulness. Speaking truth in casual conversation, giving when amounts seem small, serving when no one notices.

Don''t wait for the big test to practice obedience. The big tests reveal what small tests have built. Today we commit to small faithfulness that builds capacity for large obedience.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored small obediences. Today we examine obedience in community—we need others on this journey.

"Encourage one another daily, as long as it is called ''Today,'' so that none of you may be hardened by sin''s deceitfulness" (Hebrews 3:13). Community provides encouragement for obedience and accountability against compromise.

Who encourages your obedience? Who challenges your comfort-seeking? We need people who will speak truth, ask hard questions, and walk alongside us in difficult paths. Today we strengthen our obedience community.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored biblical examples, trusting God''s character, the obedience process, comfort''s deception, obedience''s fruit, small faithfulness, and community support. Today we commit to obedience over comfort.

"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me... Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37-38). Discipleship costs.

As you complete this study, where is comfort competing with obedience? What hard choice awaits? Take up your cross and follow—the path of obedience leads to life.'
WHERE slug = 'obedience-over-comfort';

-- FAITH AT WORK
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 addressed difficult colleagues and bosses. Today we explore ethical dilemmas—what to do when work demands compromise.

Sometimes jobs ask us to lie, cheat, or participate in injustice. "We must obey God rather than human beings" (Acts 5:29). When human authority contradicts divine command, we follow God.

This may cost us. Daniel faced the lions'' den for praying. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego faced the furnace for refusing to bow. Count the cost, make the right choice, and trust God with consequences. Today we prepare for ethical crossroads.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed ethical dilemmas. Today we examine rest and work—honoring God''s rhythm.

God worked six days and rested one. He commands the same for us. "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy" (Exodus 20:8). In a culture of constant productivity, rest is countercultural—and essential.

Overwork isn''t faithfulness; it''s often fear or pride. Rest demonstrates trust that God provides without our constant effort. It renews us for more effective work. Today we evaluate our work-rest rhythm.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored rest and work. Today we address purpose in menial tasks—finding meaning in the mundane.

Not every task is exciting. Much work is repetitive, unglamorous, or seemingly pointless. Yet "whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord" (Colossians 3:23).

Brother Lawrence practiced the presence of God while washing dishes. Every task, done for God''s glory, becomes worship. Meaning comes not from the task itself but from whom we serve through it. Today we transform mundane work through perspective shift.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed mundane tasks. Today we explore influence—how to leverage your position for kingdom impact.

Joseph, Daniel, Nehemiah, and Esther all served pagan rulers and influenced their nations for good. Position provides platform. How can your work influence advance God''s purposes?

Influence might look like: modeling integrity, creating ethical workplace culture, mentoring younger workers, or advocating for justice. It''s not about forcing faith but about faithful presence that makes a difference. Today we consider our influence potential.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored influence. Today we address contentment—satisfaction in your current role while open to change.

"I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances" (Philippians 4:11). Paul wrote this from prison. Contentment isn''t about perfect circumstances but about trust in God''s provision and purpose.

This doesn''t mean never seeking change. But it means finding peace now, not just when conditions improve. Contentment enables present faithfulness while remaining open to God''s leading. Today we cultivate contentment in our current work.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored calling, vocation, excellence, relationships, balance, ethics, rest, mundane tasks, influence, and contentment. Today we commit to faith at work.

"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). Work is included in "whatever you do." Your job is your ministry field.

As you complete this study, how will Monday look different? What excellence will you pursue? What witness will you give? Honor God from 9 to 5—and beyond.'
WHERE slug = 'faith-at-work';

-- INTEGRITY IN A COMPROMISED WORLD
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored marketplace integrity. Today we examine integrity in speech—truth-telling when lies are easier.

"Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices" (Colossians 3:9). Lies come in many forms: outright deception, misleading omissions, exaggeration, and broken promises.

Integrity means your word can be trusted. "Let your ''Yes'' be ''Yes,'' and your ''No,'' ''No''" (Matthew 5:37). No elaborate oaths needed—just reliable speech. Today we examine our truth-telling habits.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed speech. Today we explore integrity when no one''s watching—private character.

"Nothing in all creation is hidden from God''s sight" (Hebrews 4:13). We''re never truly unwatched. The integrity question isn''t "Will I be caught?" but "Who am I when no one else knows?"

Private browsing, expense report details, time usage at work, internal thought life—these reveal true character. The public eventually reflects the private. Today we examine our hidden lives.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed private integrity. Today we explore integrity under pressure—holding firm when compromise would be easier.

Daniel was pressured to stop praying. His friends were pressured to bow. Both refused despite deadly consequences. They had already decided who they would be; the pressure revealed it.

Pre-decision is crucial. Decide now what you will and won''t do, so that pressure moments find character already formed. "But Daniel resolved not to defile himself" (Daniel 1:8). The decision preceded the pressure. Today we pre-decide.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed pressure. Today we examine integrity in success—staying humble when blessed.

"When you have eaten and are satisfied... be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God" (Deuteronomy 8:10-11). Success tests integrity differently than hardship. Pride creeps in. We credit ourselves for God''s gifts.

Integrity in success remembers the Source, shares generously, and stays humble. It''s harder than it sounds—prosperity has destroyed more than poverty. Today we prepare for success without losing integrity.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed success. Today we explore recovering integrity—what to do after you''ve failed.

Everyone fails sometimes. David committed adultery and murder but was restored. Peter denied Jesus but was recommissioned. Failure isn''t final if we respond rightly.

Recovery requires: honest confession, accepting consequences, making restitution where possible, and recommitting to integrity. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us" (1 John 1:9). Today we address any integrity failures needing correction.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored heart devotion, Daniel''s example, marketplace integrity, speech, private character, pressure, success, and recovery. Today we commit to lifelong integrity.

"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity" (Proverbs 11:3). Integrity guides; duplicity destroys.

As you complete this study, what integrity commitments will you make? Where are you vulnerable? Who will hold you accountable? Stand for truth when everyone bends. Your character is worth more than any compromise could gain.'
WHERE slug = 'integrity-compromised-world';

-- BEARING FRUIT THAT LASTS
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined pruning. Today we explore fruit that lasts—eternal impact versus temporary activity.

"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last" (John 15:16). Not all activity produces lasting fruit. Busyness isn''t necessarily fruitfulness.

What lasts? Changed lives, discipled believers, eternal investments. What doesn''t? Much of what keeps us busy. Today we evaluate: Are we producing lasting fruit or just staying active?',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored lasting fruit. Today we examine multiplication—fruit that produces more fruit.

"Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds" (John 12:24). Fruitfulness multiplies through death to self.

Making disciples who make disciples multiplies impact beyond our lifetime. Paul told Timothy: "The things you have heard me say... entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2). Today we consider how our fruit can multiply.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined multiplication. Today we address fruitfulness in different seasons—not every season is harvest.

Farmers don''t expect fruit immediately after planting. Growth takes time: planting, watering, waiting, then harvest. "See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains" (James 5:7).

Some seasons focus on planting (starting new initiatives), some on cultivating (developing what exists), some on harvesting (reaping results). Not every season looks productive. Today we discern our current season.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed seasons. Today we explore partnership—fruitfulness often comes through collaboration.

"I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow" (1 Corinthians 3:6). Different people contribute different parts. Paul planted; Apollos watered; God grew.

We don''t need to do everything ourselves. Some plant what others will harvest. Some harvest what others planted. Humble partnership produces more than solo striving. Today we consider who we''re partnering with for fruit.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored partnership. Today we examine obstacles to fruitfulness—what blocks or reduces fruit.

Potential obstacles: unconfessed sin, disobedience in known areas, disconnection from the vine (neglected relationship with Christ), wrong priorities, and wrong motives. "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" (Mark 8:36).

Removing obstacles requires honest assessment and decisive action. Cut off what hinders; cultivate what helps. Today we identify and address fruitfulness obstacles.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored abiding, fruit types, pruning, lasting impact, multiplication, seasons, partnership, and obstacles. Today we commit to fruitful living.

"This is to my Father''s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples" (John 15:8). Fruitfulness glorifies God and identifies disciples.

As you complete this study, what fruit is God producing through you? What needs attention? What obstacles need removal? Abide deeply, serve faithfully, and watch God produce fruit that lasts.'
WHERE slug = 'bearing-fruit-lasts';

-- HEAVEN, HELL, AND ETERNITY
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined the final judgment. Today we explore the nature of eternal existence—what is eternity like?

Eternity isn''t endless time but timeless existence. "With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day" (2 Peter 3:8). We''ll exist outside time''s constraints.

Heaven is described in physical terms (gates, streets, trees) not because it''s merely physical but because that''s the only language we understand. The reality exceeds our imagination. Today we stretch toward understanding eternity.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored eternity''s nature. Today we address common questions: What about people who never heard the gospel?

"Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (Genesis 18:25). We can trust God''s perfect justice and mercy even when specific questions remain unanswered.

What we know: God wants none to perish (2 Peter 3:9), Jesus is the only way (John 14:6), and humans are judged according to the light they received (Romans 2:12-16). Mystery remains, but God''s character is trustworthy. Today we trust the Judge.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 addressed difficult questions. Today we examine the intermediate state—what happens between death and resurrection?

At death, believers go immediately into Christ''s presence: "Away from the body and at home with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:8). "Today you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43).

This is not yet the final state—resurrection bodies await Christ''s return. But it''s conscious, blessed existence with Christ. Death is departure "to be with Christ, which is better by far" (Philippians 1:23). Today we find comfort in what awaits.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored the intermediate state. Today we address objections to hell—why would a loving God allow eternal punishment?

Hell raises hard questions. Yet Jesus spoke of it more than anyone. He warned because it''s real and He wants none to go there.

Several considerations: humans have genuine choice with real consequences; rejecting infinite God merits infinite consequence; hell may be the chosen isolation from God that sinners preferred; and God "does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked" (Ezekiel 33:11). Today we wrestle honestly with difficult doctrine.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed objections to hell. Today we explore how eternal destiny should shape present living.

"Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives" (2 Peter 3:11). Eschatology produces ethics—what we believe about the future shapes how we live now.

If heaven is real, invest there. If hell is real, warn people. If judgment is coming, live accountably. Today we let eternal perspective reshape temporal priorities.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored heaven, hell, judgment, eternity''s nature, difficult questions, intermediate states, objections, and present implications. Today we live with eternal perspective.

"Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things" (Colossians 3:2). Eternal reality should govern temporal choices.

As you complete this study, what perspective has shifted? How will you live differently? Who needs to hear about eternal life? Live as a citizen of heaven, temporarily stationed on earth.'
WHERE slug = 'heaven-hell-eternity';

-- READY FOR RETURN & HOPE IN FINAL VICTORY & JUSTICE AND MERCY
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined reward for faithfulness. Today we explore watching—the posture of readiness.

"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come" (Matthew 24:42). Watching means living expectantly, not anxiously—with eyes on the door for the Master''s return.

Practically, watching involves: maintaining spiritual disciplines, avoiding entanglements that would embarrass us at His coming, and staying engaged in His work. Today we cultivate the watching posture.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored watching. Today we address working while waiting—readiness isn''t passive.

"Occupy till I come" (Luke 19:13 KJV). The waiting servants were to invest their master''s money, not bury it. Active engagement, not passive waiting.

Jesus could return today, or generations might pass. Either way, we work faithfully: sharing the gospel, making disciples, serving the poor, pursuing justice. Today we commit to active readiness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined working while waiting. Today we explore signs of the times—what should we watch for?

Jesus described signs: wars, famines, earthquakes, persecution, false teachers, and the gospel preached to all nations (Matthew 24). These signs have been present throughout history but may intensify near the end.

We should watch without date-setting: "No one knows about that day or hour" (Matthew 24:36). Stay ready always rather than trying to calculate timing. Today we observe signs while maintaining humility.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed signs. Today we examine how readiness affects relationships—living rightly with others in light of His coming.

"Since everything will be destroyed in this way... make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him" (2 Peter 3:11, 14). Readiness includes relational health.

Are there relationships needing reconciliation? Offenses needing forgiveness? Conversations needing to happen? Live ready by living rightly with others. Today we address relational readiness.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored relational readiness. Today we address false alarms—staying ready when time passes and He hasn''t come.

"Where is this ''coming'' he promised?" scoffers ask (2 Peter 3:4). Centuries have passed. How do we stay ready when delay tempts discouragement?

Remember: "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish" (2 Peter 3:9). Delay is mercy for more to be saved. Today we renew readiness despite delay.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored signs, practical readiness, watching, working, relationships, and perseverance. Today we commit to living ready.

"Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man" (Luke 21:36).

As you complete this study, how ready are you? What adjustments will you make? Live every day as if He might come today—because He might.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined the new heaven and earth. Today we explore the destruction of evil—God''s final judgment on all that opposes Him.

"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur... tormented day and night for ever and ever" (Revelation 20:10). Evil''s defeat is total and permanent.

This isn''t vindictive but just. Evil has caused incalculable suffering. God''s victory means evil finally gets what it deserves—and can never harm again. Today we anticipate justice for all wrong.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined evil''s destruction. Today we explore our participation in victory—we share in Christ''s triumph.

"To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne" (Revelation 3:21). We reign with Christ!

Our small faithfulness here contributes to eternal victory there. "Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?" (1 Corinthians 6:2). Today we see our present choices as victory participation.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored our participation. Today we address waiting for victory—how to endure when evil seems to win.

"I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain... They called out in a loud voice, ''How long, Sovereign Lord?''" (Revelation 6:9-10). Even martyrs in heaven ask "how long?"

The answer: "Wait a little longer" (Revelation 6:11). Victory is certain but timing is God''s. We wait with hope, not despair, because we know the end. Today we cultivate patient hope.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed waiting for victory. Today we explore present victory—the battle is won even while skirmishes continue.

"The prince of this world now stands condemned" (John 16:11). Satan is already defeated; he''s just not yet removed. We fight from victory, not for it.

This changes our posture. We''re not desperate defenders but confident victors. "In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us" (Romans 8:37). Today we fight as those who''ve already won.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored present victory. Today we examine victory''s celebration—the wedding feast of the Lamb.

"Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!" (Revelation 19:9). Victory culminates in celebration. The marriage of Christ and His bride (the church) is consummated in joy.

Heaven isn''t just absence of bad but presence of good—feasting, joy, celebration forever. The best wedding you''ve attended is shadow; this is substance. Today we anticipate the celebration.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored God''s victory, evil''s defeat, our participation, patient waiting, present victory posture, and ultimate celebration. Today we live as victors.

"Thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:57). Victory is gift—we receive and live in it.

As you complete this study, how does certain victory change your present struggles? Live today in light of that inevitable triumph. We win.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 examined the cross as intersection of justice and mercy. Today we explore how justice and mercy shape Christian living.

We''re to reflect God''s character: "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8).

Acting justly means pursuing fairness, opposing oppression, and treating others rightly. Loving mercy means extending compassion beyond what''s deserved. Both together. Today we examine our justice-mercy balance.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 addressed personal living. Today we explore justice in society—God cares about systemic righteousness.

"Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow" (Isaiah 1:17). God''s concern extends beyond individual salvation to societal structures.

Christians have historically fought injustice: slavery, child labor, poverty. We continue that legacy. What injustices need addressing today? Today we consider our role in social justice.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined social justice. Today we address mercy for the guilty—God''s scandalous grace.

The thief on the cross received paradise despite a lifetime of crime (Luke 23:43). This offends our sense of fairness. It should—grace is unfair. It gives what isn''t deserved.

"While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). We were the guilty who received mercy. How can we withhold it from others? Today we extend scandalous grace.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored mercy for the guilty. Today we examine the tension—how do we pursue justice while extending mercy?

Some situations seem to demand one or the other. Should the abuser be forgiven? Should the oppressor go unpunished? These aren''t easy questions.

Both justice and mercy matter. We can pursue justice (consequences, protection for victims, accountability) while extending mercy (refusing bitterness, releasing to God, hoping for repentance). Today we navigate this tension.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 addressed tension. Today we explore trusting God''s justice—leaving vengeance to Him.

"Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God''s wrath, for it is written: ''It is mine to avenge; I will repay,'' says the Lord" (Romans 12:19). When justice isn''t served here, we trust God to serve it ultimately.

This doesn''t mean ignoring injustice but releasing personal vengeance. We pursue justice through proper channels while trusting God with ultimate outcomes. Today we release what we can''t fix to the Judge of all.',
day10_context = 'We''ve explored God''s justice and mercy, their meeting at the cross, personal application, social dimensions, grace for the guilty, navigating tension, and trusting God. Today we become people of justice and mercy.

"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy" (Matthew 5:7). "Learn to do right; seek justice" (Isaiah 1:17). Both commands stand.

As you complete this study, how will you act justly? How will you love mercy? Walk humbly with your God who perfectly embodies both—and learn from Him.'

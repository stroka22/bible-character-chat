SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored Amos and Obadiah. Today we examine Jonah—the reluctant prophet who learned about God''s compassion.

Jonah ran from God''s call to preach to Nineveh. After the fish, he obeyed—and preached with such power that the entire city repented. Then Jonah sulked because God showed mercy.

"Should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh?" (Jonah 4:11). God''s compassion extends further than His prophets'' comfort. Today we see God''s heart for even enemies.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined Jonah. Today we explore Micah—justice, mercy, and walking humbly.

Micah thundered against injustice in Israel and Judah. Leaders were corrupt; prophets were for hire; the rich oppressed the poor. But Micah also saw hope.

"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). Today we hear the prophetic call to authentic faith.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined Micah. Today we explore Nahum—God''s judgment on Nineveh (again).

A century after Jonah, Nineveh had returned to wickedness. Nahum proclaimed its doom: "The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished" (Nahum 1:3).

Nineveh fell in 612 BC, just as prophesied. Today we see that patience has limits.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 examined Nahum. Today we explore Habakkuk—the prophet who questioned God.

Habakkuk asked: Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? God answered: I''m raising Babylon to judge Judah. Habakkuk''s second question: Why use someone more wicked to punish the wicked?

God''s answer: the righteous will live by faith; Babylon too will be judged. "Though the fig tree does not bud... yet I will rejoice in the LORD" (Habakkuk 3:17-18). Today we learn faith amid confusion.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Habakkuk. Today we explore Zephaniah—the day of the LORD.

Zephaniah prophesied during Josiah''s reign, warning of coming judgment. "The great day of the LORD is near... That day will be a day of wrath" (Zephaniah 1:14-15). But beyond judgment comes restoration.

"The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you" (3:17). Today we see judgment leading to joy.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 examined Zephaniah. Today we explore Haggai—rebuilding the temple.

The exiles had returned but neglected the temple while building their own homes. Haggai confronted their priorities: "Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?" (Haggai 1:4).

They responded; the temple was completed. Today we examine our priorities.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 examined Haggai. Today we explore Zechariah—visions and the coming King.

Zechariah''s visions encouraged the temple builders with images of future glory. His prophecies point to Christ: the Branch, the Shepherd who would be struck, the King coming on a donkey.

"Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey" (Zechariah 9:9). Today we see messianic hope.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 examined Zechariah. Today we explore Malachi—the last prophetic voice.

Malachi addressed a cynical, weary people. They offered defective sacrifices, divorced their wives, withheld tithes, and questioned whether serving God was worthwhile.

"I the LORD do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed" (Malachi 3:6). After Malachi, 400 years of prophetic silence—until John the Baptist. Today we hear the Old Testament''s last word.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored Malachi. Today we examine themes across the Minor Prophets.

Common themes include: God''s covenant faithfulness, the call to repentance, judgment on sin (Israel''s and nations''), the "day of the LORD," and hope for restoration. Different voices, unified message.

These twelve small books pack enormous theological punch. Today we synthesize their shared message.',
day14_context = 'We''ve surveyed the Minor Prophets: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

Twelve diverse voices spanning centuries, all declaring: God is holy, sin has consequences, repentance is possible, and hope remains.

As you complete this study, which prophet''s message most resonates with your situation? These ancient words still speak. Listen and respond.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored internal righteousness vs. external show. Today we continue examining Jesus'' ethics: anger, lust, and integrity.

"You have heard that it was said... But I tell you" (Matthew 5:21-22). Jesus addresses not just murder but anger, not just adultery but lust, not just oath-breaking but all deception.

Internal reality matters. Heart precedes hand. Today we examine the deeper righteousness Jesus requires.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 examined heart issues. Today we explore Jesus'' teaching on relationships—reconciliation, enemies, divorce.

"If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you... first go and be reconciled" (Matthew 5:23-24). Right worship requires right relationships.

Love your enemies. Pray for persecutors. Be peacemakers. Today we see relational righteousness.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored relationships. Today we examine spiritual practices—giving, praying, fasting (Matthew 6:1-18).

"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them" (Matthew 6:1). The issue isn''t whether to practice but how—for audience of God or audience of people?

Secret giving, private prayer, hidden fasting—these please the Father who sees in secret. Today we examine our motivations.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 addressed spiritual practices. Today we examine the Lord''s Prayer—the model Jesus gave (Matthew 6:9-13).

Our Father—intimate relationship. In heaven—transcendent glory. Hallowed be your name—worship precedes requests. Your kingdom come—His agenda first. Give us daily bread—dependent trust. Forgive as we forgive—interconnected grace. Lead us not into temptation—humble reliance.

Every phrase is loaded. Today we pray the prayer slowly.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored the Lord''s Prayer. Today we examine money and worry (Matthew 6:19-34).

"You cannot serve both God and money" (6:24). Money makes a terrible master. Where treasure is, heart follows.

"Do not worry" appears three times. Look at birds; consider lilies. Your Father knows your needs. "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you" (6:33). Today we address worry with truth.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored money and worry. Today we examine judging and discernment (Matthew 7:1-6).

"Do not judge, or you too will be judged" (7:1). But also: "Do not give dogs what is sacred" (7:6). Which is it? Hypocritical judging is condemned; wise discernment is required.

First remove your plank; then help with specks. Judge yourself first. Today we balance non-judgment with discernment.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 addressed judging. Today we explore asking, seeking, knocking—and the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:7-12).

"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened" (7:7). God is a good Father who gives good gifts.

"In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you" (7:12). The Golden Rule summarizes all ethics. Today we ask boldly and treat others well.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored asking and the Golden Rule. Today we examine two ways—narrow gate, false prophets, tree and fruit (Matthew 7:13-23).

The narrow gate is less traveled but leads to life. Wide gate is popular but leads to destruction.

"By their fruit you will recognize them" (7:20). Claims aren''t enough; even miracles aren''t enough. Jesus will say to some: "I never knew you." Today we examine our fruit.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 examined two ways. Today we conclude with two builders—the parable that ends the sermon (Matthew 7:24-27).

"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock" (7:24). Hearing isn''t enough; practice matters.

Storms come to both houses. Only one stands. Today we commit to building on rock.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through the Sermon on the Mount: Beatitudes, salt and light, surpassing righteousness, heart issues, relationships, practices, prayer, money, worry, judgment, asking, two ways, and two builders.

"The crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority" (Matthew 7:28-29).

As you complete this study, which teaching most challenges you? This isn''t suggestion but command from our King. Will you build on this rock?'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored God''s omniscience. Today we examine His omnipotence—all-powerful, nothing impossible.

"Is anything too hard for the LORD?" (Genesis 18:14). God creates from nothing, sustains everything, and will one day renew all things. No force opposes Him successfully.

"Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him" (Psalm 115:3). This isn''t arbitrary power but purposeful sovereignty. Today we trust the One for whom nothing is impossible.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored omnipotence. Today we examine God''s omnipresence—everywhere present.

"Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?" (Psalm 139:7). God isn''t located in one place; He fills all creation. You cannot escape Him—or be abandoned by Him.

This is comfort, not threat. Wherever you go, He''s there. Today we practice awareness of His presence.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored omnipresence. Today we examine God''s immutability—He doesn''t change.

"I the LORD do not change" (Malachi 3:6). His character remains constant. His purposes don''t shift. His promises don''t expire.

This provides security in an unstable world. The God of Abraham is your God. Today we anchor in His unchanging nature.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored immutability. Today we examine God''s eternity—beyond time.

"Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole earth, from everlasting to everlasting you are God" (Psalm 90:2). God has no beginning, no end, and isn''t bound by time.

He sees past, present, and future simultaneously. Today we worship the eternal One.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored eternity. Today we examine God''s holiness—set apart, pure, other.

"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty" (Isaiah 6:3). Seraphim cover their faces. Isaiah cries "Woe to me!" Holiness separates God from all creation in moral purity.

"Be holy, because I am holy" (1 Peter 1:16). We''re called to reflect His holiness. Today we approach the Holy One.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored holiness. Today we examine God''s love—not just what He does but who He is.

"God is love" (1 John 4:8). Love isn''t merely an attribute among many; it characterizes His essence. The cross demonstrates love''s depths.

"This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son" (1 John 4:10). Today we rest in divine love.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored love. Today we examine God''s justice—righteous judgment.

"He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just" (Deuteronomy 32:4). God cannot ignore evil. Justice demands response to sin.

But at the cross, justice and mercy meet. Sin is punished; sinners are forgiven. Today we trust the just Judge.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored justice. Today we examine God''s mercy—compassion toward the undeserving.

"The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness" (Exodus 34:6). Mercy triumphs over judgment for those who repent.

We don''t get what we deserve; we get grace instead. Today we receive mercy.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored mercy. Today we examine God''s faithfulness—keeping every promise.

"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations" (Deuteronomy 7:9). What He promises, He performs.

"God is faithful, who has called you" (1 Corinthians 1:9). Bank on His faithfulness. Today we trust the promise-keeper.',
day14_context = 'We''ve explored God''s character: sovereignty, goodness, omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, immutability, eternity, holiness, love, justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" (Romans 11:33).

As you complete this study, which attribute most needed emphasis in your view of God? Know Him better. He is all this—and infinitely more.'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the Mosaic covenant. Today we examine its expansion—the blessings and curses of Deuteronomy.

Deuteronomy 28 details covenant blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. The lists are extensive. Blessing: prosperity, health, victory. Curse: disease, defeat, exile.

Israel chose, and history records the consequences. Today we see that covenantal life involves real choices with real outcomes.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored blessings and curses. Today we examine the Davidic covenant—a throne forever.

"Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever" (2 Samuel 7:16). God promised David a dynasty that would never end.

Human Davidic kings failed, but the promise stands—fulfilled ultimately in Christ, David''s greater Son. Today we trace the royal covenant.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 examined the Davidic covenant. Today we explore its conditionality—individual discipline, unconditional promise.

Individual kings faced discipline for disobedience. Solomon''s kingdom was divided. Others were removed. But the line continued. The promise was unconditional; the individual experience was conditional.

"When he does wrong, I will punish him... But my love will never be taken away" (2 Samuel 7:14-15). Today we see nuanced covenant faithfulness.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored Davidic nuances. Today we examine prophetic anticipation of the new covenant.

"The days are coming... when I will make a new covenant... I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts" (Jeremiah 31:31-33). The prophets looked forward to something better.

Internal transformation. Complete forgiveness. Universal knowledge of God. Today we see the old covenant pointing beyond itself.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored prophetic anticipation. Today we examine Jesus inaugurating the new covenant.

"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you" (Luke 22:20). Jesus'' death established what prophets predicted.

The new covenant brings: complete forgiveness (Hebrews 10:17-18), the Spirit''s indwelling (Ezekiel 36:27), and access to God (Hebrews 10:19). Today we receive new covenant blessings.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw new covenant inauguration. Today we explore the relationship between covenants—continuity and discontinuity.

Are old covenants replaced or fulfilled? Both/and. Jesus fulfilled what was promised; He also brought something new. Old covenant types give way to new covenant realities.

"The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Today we trace the covenant story''s progression.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored covenant relationships. Today we examine the sign of the new covenant—not circumcision but baptism and communion.

Baptism initiates into the covenant community. Communion regularly renews covenant remembrance. These signs point to covenant realities: union with Christ, feeding on Christ.

"Is not the cup of thanksgiving... a participation in the blood of Christ?" (1 Corinthians 10:16). Today we practice covenant signs.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored covenant signs. Today we examine covenant community—the church as covenant people.

Israel was a covenant community; the church is the new covenant community. We belong to each other because we belong to Christ.

"You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God''s special possession" (1 Peter 2:9). Today we embrace covenant community identity.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored covenant community. Today we examine covenant consummation—where it''s all heading.

"God''s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them" (Revelation 21:3). The covenant promise of "I will be their God, and they will be my people" finds ultimate fulfillment in the new creation.

All covenants point here. Today we anticipate covenant completion.',
day14_context = 'We''ve traced covenants: creation, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and the new covenant in Christ—their relationships, signs, community, and consummation.

"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matthew 26:28).

As you complete this study, do you understand your covenant relationship with God better? You belong to Him; He belongs to you. Live as covenant people.'

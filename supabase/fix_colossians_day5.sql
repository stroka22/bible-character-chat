-- Add Day 5 context for Colossians in 5 Days
UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'We conclude Colossians by examining chapter 4—practical instructions for Christian living.

Paul instructs: "Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful" (Colossians 4:2). Prayer anchors the Christian life. He asks for prayer that God would "open a door for our message" (4:3).

Then wisdom for outsiders: "Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" (4:5-6). Our speech and conduct witness to Christ.

Paul closes with greetings, revealing his network of co-workers: Tychicus, Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, Justus, Epaphras, Luke, and Demas. Christianity is communal, not solitary.

As you complete Colossians, remember its core message: Christ is supreme over all—philosophy, tradition, legalism, and mysticism. In Him "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (2:3). You are "complete in Him" (2:10). Live from that fullness.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 explored the Passover. Today we examine the tabernacle and temple—God dwelling among His people.

The tabernacle was structured to demonstrate both God''s presence and human inability to approach Him directly. Curtain upon curtain, restriction upon restriction—only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, once a year, with blood.

"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling [tabernacled] among us" (John 1:14). Jesus is the true tabernacle. When He died, the temple curtain tore. Today we see access to God through Christ.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 explored the tabernacle. Today we examine the sacrificial system—blood covering sin.

Levitical sacrifices never truly removed sin: "It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins" (Hebrews 10:4). They pointed forward to the sacrifice that would.

"Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Hebrews 9:22). Every animal sacrifice was a sermon about the Lamb who would come. Today we see Jesus as the final sacrifice.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 explored sacrifices. Today we examine the Day of Atonement—the high priest''s annual entrance.

Once a year, the high priest entered the Most Holy Place with blood for his sins and the people''s. He wore plain linen, not ornate robes. Two goats: one sacrificed, one sent away bearing the people''s sins.

"Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands... he entered heaven itself" (Hebrews 9:24). Jesus is our high priest who made atonement once for all. Today we see the Day of Atonement fulfilled.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 explored the Day of Atonement. Today we examine prophecies of Christ—specific predictions fulfilled.

Isaiah 53: the suffering servant, pierced for our transgressions. Micah 5:2: born in Bethlehem. Zechariah 9:9: entering Jerusalem on a donkey. Psalm 22: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"—and the details of crucifixion.

"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms" (Luke 24:44). Today we trace prophetic fulfillment.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored prophecies. Today we examine types of Christ—people and events foreshadowing Jesus.

Adam is a type of Christ (Romans 5:14)—the representative of a people. Joseph, betrayed and exalted to save his brothers. Moses, the deliverer. David, the shepherd-king. Jonah, three days and resurrected.

The Old Testament is Christ-centered even when not explicitly about Him. Today we see Jesus in unexpected places.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored types of Christ. Today we examine the covenant of grace—one plan through all Scripture.

From Genesis 3:15''s promise to crush the serpent, through Abraham, Moses, David, and the new covenant—one continuous plan of grace unfolds. Different administrations, same promise.

"He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3:6). Today we trace the unified covenant of grace.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored the covenant of grace. Today we see the gospel in Israel''s feasts.

Passover: Christ''s sacrifice (1 Corinthians 5:7). Firstfruits: Christ''s resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20). Pentecost: the Spirit''s coming (Acts 2). Tabernacles: God dwelling with us (John 7:37-39).

The Jewish calendar was a gospel calendar. Today we see Christ in Israel''s worship rhythm.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 explored feasts. Today we see the gospel in Israel''s wilderness journey.

The rock that provided water was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4). The manna from heaven was Christ (John 6:32-35). The bronze serpent lifted up was Christ (John 3:14-15).

Every provision pointed to the greater provision. Today we see Israel''s journey as gospel picture.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 explored the wilderness. Today we see the gospel in the Psalms and Wisdom literature.

Psalm 2: the King whom nations must kiss. Psalm 16: resurrection from the grave. Psalm 110: the priest-king at God''s right hand. Proverbs 8: Wisdom personified, present at creation—Christ Himself.

Even Israel''s songs and wisdom pointed to Christ. Today we hear the gospel in Israel''s poetry.',
day14_context = 'We''ve traced the gospel through the Old Testament: proto-evangelion, Abraham, Passover, tabernacle, sacrifices, Day of Atonement, prophecies, types, covenant, feasts, wilderness, and wisdom.

"Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself" (Luke 24:27). The Old Testament is about Jesus.

As you complete this study, how will you read the Old Testament differently? See Christ on every page.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed Jericho''s fall. Today we see failure at Ai—sin in the camp.

Confident from Jericho, Israel attacked Ai without proper preparation. They were routed. Why? Achan had taken forbidden plunder from Jericho.

"Israel has sinned... That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies" (Joshua 7:11-12). One person''s hidden sin affected everyone. Today we see that private sin has public consequences.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw Achan''s sin. Today we witness victory at Ai after dealing with sin.

Achan was exposed and judged. Then God instructed a battle plan for Ai involving ambush tactics. Israel obeyed and won.

"Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai" (Joshua 8:1). After dealing with sin, God restored Israel''s ability to fight. Today we see restoration after repentance.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 saw victory at Ai. Today we witness Israel''s deception by the Gibeonites—failing to consult God.

The Gibeonites pretended to be from far away, tricking Israel into a treaty. "The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD" (Joshua 9:14).

The treaty stood—Israel kept their word even when deceived. But the failure to seek God''s guidance caused ongoing problems. Today we learn the importance of seeking God before decisions.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw the Gibeonite deception. Today we witness the sun standing still—God fighting for Israel.

Gibeonite allies were attacked. Israel came to defend them. Joshua needed more time: "Sun, stand still over Gibeon." The sun stopped for about a day.

"Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!" (Joshua 10:14). Today we see God doing the impossible to keep His promises.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 witnessed the sun standing still. Today we see the southern and northern campaigns—conquest expanding.

Joshua conducted a swift southern campaign, defeating five kings and their cities. Then he turned north, defeating a coalition led by Jabin king of Hazor.

"So Joshua took this entire land... Then the land had rest from war" (Joshua 11:23). Today we see methodical fulfillment of God''s promise.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 saw the campaigns completed. Today we see the land divided among the tribes—inheritance distributed.

Chapters 13-21 detail tribal allotments. Caleb claimed Hebron, remembering God''s promise forty-five years earlier. Each tribe received their inheritance, though some didn''t fully drive out the inhabitants.

"Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave" (Joshua 21:45). Today we see faithful God giving promised inheritance.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 saw land division. Today we see the eastern tribes'' altar—misunderstanding almost causing civil war.

The tribes settling east of Jordan built a large altar. The western tribes assumed idolatry and prepared for war. But the altar was a memorial, not for sacrifice—a witness that they too belonged to Israel.

Communication clarified the misunderstanding. Today we see the danger of assumptions and the value of dialogue.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 saw the altar misunderstanding. Today we hear Joshua''s farewell challenge—"choose for yourselves."

Joshua gathered Israel and reviewed God''s faithfulness. Then the challenge: "If serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve."

"But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD" (Joshua 24:15). Today we hear the call to decisive commitment.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 heard Joshua''s challenge. Today we examine themes: faithfulness, obedience, and incomplete conquest.

God was completely faithful—every promise kept. Israel''s obedience brought victory; disobedience brought defeat. But conquest was incomplete—Canaanites remained, setting up future problems.

"Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses" (Joshua 23:6). Today we see the pattern: God''s faithfulness, human response, and consequences.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Joshua: transition, preparation, crossing, Jericho, Ai, campaigns, land division, near-civil-war, and Joshua''s farewell.

"You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled" (Joshua 23:14).

As you complete this study, what has Joshua''s story taught you? About God''s faithfulness? About obedience''s importance? About incomplete obedience''s consequences? God keeps His promises—will you keep your commitment?'

UPDATE public.reading_plans
SET day5_context = 'Day 4 introduced the cycle and early judges. Today we meet Gideon—unlikely deliverer requiring confirmation.

Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide from Midianites. The angel addressed him: "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior." Gideon''s response: doubt and questions.

God patiently provided signs: the fleece wet then dry. Gideon finally believed. Today we see God patiently working with a doubter.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 introduced Gideon. Today we see his victory—300 men defeating a vast army.

God reduced Gideon''s army from 32,000 to 300, "lest Israel boast against me, saying, ''My own hand has saved me''" (Judges 7:2). With torches, jars, and trumpets, they routed the Midianites.

Victory came through weakness, not strength. Today we see God''s power displayed through human inadequacy.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 witnessed Gideon''s victory. Today we see his failure—the ephod that became a snare.

Gideon refused to be king but made a gold ephod from the spoil. "All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family" (Judges 8:27).

Good beginnings don''t guarantee good endings. Gideon the deliverer became Gideon the snare-maker. Today we see how success can lead to failure.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 saw Gideon''s failure. Today we meet Jephthah—the outcast who became judge.

Jephthah was driven out by his half-brothers as a prostitute''s son. But when Ammon attacked, Israel begged him to lead. He did—and won.

But he made a rash vow, and his daughter paid the price. Today we see the tragedy of foolish words.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 examined Jephthah. Today we begin Samson''s story—miraculous birth, Nazirite calling.

An angel announced Samson''s birth to his barren mother: "He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines" (Judges 13:5). He was to be a Nazirite—set apart.

From before birth, Samson was marked for God''s purposes. Today we see divine calling before human awareness.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 introduced Samson. Today we see his strength and his weakness—Spirit-empowered but self-destructive.

The Spirit rushed upon Samson, enabling superhuman feats. He killed a lion, defeated Philistines, broke ropes. But he also pursued Philistine women, broke his Nazirite vows, and followed his desires.

"He did not know that the LORD had left him" (Judges 16:20). Today we see gifts without character.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Samson''s contradictions. Today we witness his downfall—Delilah discovering the secret.

Delilah pestered Samson until "he was sick to death of it" and told her everything. His hair was cut; his strength left; the Philistines captured and blinded him.

"The dead he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life" (Judges 16:30). Even in tragedy, God used him. Today we see the cost of compromise.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 witnessed Samson''s fall. Today we enter the epilogue: "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (Judges 17:6).

The final chapters show religious corruption (Micah''s idolatry), moral collapse (the Levite''s concubine), and tribal warfare (Benjamin nearly destroyed). Complete chaos.

Without leadership, without obedience, society disintegrates. Today we see where everyone doing "what was right in their own eyes" leads.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw societal collapse. Today we reflect on the cycle: sin, suffering, crying out, deliverance, peace—then repeat.

Israel never learned permanently. Each generation repeated the pattern. The judges provided temporary relief, not lasting change.

The book points to the need for a king, but beyond that, the need for a better deliverer than any human judge could be. Today we see the longing for lasting salvation.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed through Judges: the cycle, Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, and the chaos of the epilogue.

"In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (Judges 21:25). The book ends where it began—in need.

As you complete this study, what has Judges taught you? About human nature? About God''s patience? About the need for real salvation? Judges is a dark book that makes us long for a King who truly saves.'

SET day5_context = 'Day 4 witnessed the temple built. Today we see its dedication—God''s glory filling the house.

Solomon spoke a remarkable prayer acknowledging that heaven cannot contain God, much less a temple. Yet he asked God to hear prayers offered toward this place.

"When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering... The glory of the LORD filled the temple" (2 Chronicles 7:1). Today we witness God accepting the house built for His name.',
day6_context = 'Day 5 saw the temple dedicated. Today we hear God''s conditional promise—blessing requires faithfulness.

God appeared to Solomon at night with promise and warning: "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray... then I will hear from heaven" (2 Chronicles 7:14).

But also warning: if they abandon God, He will reject the temple and make Israel an object of ridicule. Today we hear both promise and warning.',
day7_context = 'Day 6 heard God''s promise and warning. Today we see Solomon''s wealth and fame—prosperity like no other.

"King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth" (1 Kings 10:23). The Queen of Sheba came and was overwhelmed: "The report I heard... did not tell me half of it."

Everything Solomon touched prospered. But prosperity contains danger. Today we see blessing that would become burden.',
day8_context = 'Day 7 witnessed Solomon''s prosperity. Today we examine his proverbs—wisdom for daily living.

Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs and wrote the book of Proverbs. Topics: wisdom vs. folly, diligence vs. laziness, speech, money, relationships, parenting, leadership.

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10). Solomon''s proverbs teach practical godliness. Today we sample wisdom from Israel''s wisest.',
day9_context = 'Day 8 explored Proverbs. Today we examine Ecclesiastes—wisdom''s limits.

"Meaningless! Meaningless!... Everything is meaningless" (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Solomon explored pleasure, achievement, wisdom, wealth—and found them all "chasing after the wind."

Under the sun, nothing satisfies. Only eternity gives meaning to time. Today we wrestle with Ecclesiastes'' difficult wisdom.',
day10_context = 'Day 9 explored Ecclesiastes. Today we examine Song of Songs—celebrating love.

The Song of Songs celebrates romantic love between husband and wife. It''s frank, beautiful, and in the Bible.

"Love is as strong as death... Many waters cannot quench love" (Song of Songs 8:6-7). God gave romantic love; it deserves celebration. Today we see wisdom applied to love.',
day11_context = 'Day 10 explored Song of Songs. Today we see Solomon''s downfall begin—many wives, divided heart.

"King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women... He had seven hundred wives... and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray" (1 Kings 11:1-3). The wisest man made the most foolish choices.

He built high places for his wives'' gods. His heart was not fully devoted like David''s. Today we see the beginning of the end.',
day12_context = 'Day 11 saw compromise begin. Today we see consequences accumulate—enemies raised, kingdom promised to another.

God raised adversaries against Solomon and announced through a prophet: "I will tear the kingdom from your son''s hand" (1 Kings 11:12). The golden age was ending.

Solomon couldn''t undo decades of compromise. Today we see that consequences follow choices—even for the wise.',
day13_context = 'Day 12 saw consequences. Today we see the kingdom divide—the bitter fruit of Solomon''s later years.

After Solomon''s death, his son Rehoboam rejected wise counsel and oppressed the people further. Ten tribes rebelled. The united kingdom of David and Solomon split permanently.

"The king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD" (1 Kings 12:15). Today we see the tragic aftermath of a compromised reign.',
day14_context = 'We''ve journeyed with Solomon: divine gift of wisdom, building the temple, unmatched prosperity, wisdom literature, then compromise, consequences, and kingdom division.

"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" (Mark 8:36). Solomon gained everything and lost what mattered.

As you complete this study, what has Solomon''s life taught you? Wisdom without faithfulness isn''t enough. Finishing well matters more than starting well. Guard your heart.'

## 1  Error Diagnosis & Root Causes

| Symptom (User-visible) | Underlying Cause | Details |
|------------------------|------------------|---------|
| “Sorry, something went wrong” banner after selecting a character | 409 *Conflict* from `POST /chats` | Supabase table **chats** has a unique/permission constraint that blocked inserts; the error was surfaced to the UI as a generic failure. |
| Continuous error when sending first message | `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'content')` | Assistant placeholder removed prematurely when chat creation failed; `messages[messages.length−1]` was `undefined`. |
| Chat silently fails without OpenAI key | No fallback logic | OpenAI service rejected the request; ChatContext treated it as fatal. |
| Build broke after mock JSON import | Top-level `await` not supported in Vite target | `mockResponseService.js` tried dynamic import with assertion causing bundle failure. |

## 2  Solutions Implemented

### 2.1 Database / Repository Layer
1. **Fallback Mechanism**  
   *chatRepository.js* now detects Supabase errors (`403`, `409`, pg code `23505`).  
   When detected it switches to **mockChatRepository** (localStorage-based) for all future operations (`useMock` flag).

2. **mockChatRepository**  
   • Fully mimics CRUD on `chats` and `chat_messages` using localStorage.  
   • Generates UUID-like IDs, maintains timestamps, favorites, deletes, etc.  
   • Enables offline demos and prevents front-end crashes when DB is mis-configured.

### 2.2 Chat Flow / Context
1. **sendMessage Flow**  
   • Accumulates streamed chunks in `assistantContent` then saves entire reply (prevents `undefined.content`).  
   • Removes assistant placeholder only on error.  
   • Added `retryLastMessage()` that re-sends the last user message.

2. **selectCharacter Flow**  
   • Creates chat via repository; on failure still displays opening line in local mode.

### 2.3 Mock Response Engine
1. **Static JSON Import**  
   Replaced top-level `await` with static `import mockResponsesData` to satisfy Vite.  
2. **Service Functions**  
   `generateMockResponse`, `streamMockResponse`, `areMockResponsesAvailable` supply rich character replies and simulate streaming.

### 2.4 OpenAI Integration
1. **Graceful Degradation**  
   In `openai.js` every GPT call is wrapped in `try/catch`.  
   • If key missing or request fails → automatically falls back to mock engine.  
   • Browser console warns but UI keeps working.

### 2.5 UI Enhancements
1. **Error Banner Improvements** – Clarifies root cause and offers “Retry”.  
2. **Typing Indicator** – Works in both GPT and mock modes.

## 3  How to Test

### 3.1 Startup
```bash
npm install            # first time only
./run-app.sh           # builds & launches on http://localhost:5186
```

### 3.2 Happy Path
1. Home → click “Jesus (Final)”.  
2. Chat opens with opening line.  
3. Type “What is faith?” → streamed answer appears.  
   • If OpenAI key present → GPT-4 text.  
   • If not → mock response still streams.

### 3.3 Database Failure Simulation
1. Temporarily revoke `insert` on `chats` in Supabase **or** disconnect internet.  
2. Refresh, start new chat.  
3. Initial Supabase call fails → console shows  
   `[chatRepository] Supabase error detected – switching to mockChatRepository…`  
4. Chat still works; data stored locally (check `localStorage > bible_character_chat_*`).

### 3.4 OpenAI Failure Simulation
1. Comment out `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`, rebuild & run.  
2. Send a message – console warns about missing key; mock replies stream normally.

### 3.5 Retry Mechanism
1. Turn off Wi-Fi mid-stream.  
2. Banner appears; click **Retry** → last user message is resent when connection returns.

## 4  Future Considerations & Hardening

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Supabase RLS | Implement fine-grained Row Level Security and service-role Edge Function instead of direct anon writes. |
| Conflict Handling | Add *upsert* logic with compound keys (`user_id`,`character_id`) to prevent 409s. |
| Sync Offline Data | Provide background job to sync localStorage chats back to Supabase when connectivity restores. |
| Rate Limiting | Proxy OpenAI calls through a backend to enforce quotas & caching. |
| Testing | Add Jest + React Testing Library unit tests for ChatContext, repositories, and mock engines. |
| Performance | Code-split large bundles; move mock JSON to lazy-loaded chunk to cut initial JS <500 kB. |
| Accessibility | Full WCAG 2.2 audit (focus order, ARIA live regions for streaming text). |
| Monitoring | Hook Supabase Edge Logs + Sentry for error tracking in production. |

### Conclusion

The chat system now tolerates:

• Supabase permission errors  
• Network outages  
• Missing or invalid OpenAI keys  

while continuing to deliver a seamless user experience through a layered fallback architecture.

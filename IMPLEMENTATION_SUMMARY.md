# Implementation Summary

## 1 ▪ CSV Import Issue Fixed
The Admin-panel bulk CSV upload silently dropped several “Character Insights” fields.  
Root cause: `characterRepository.bulkCreateCharacters()` filtered incoming objects against an outdated `knownFields` list, so anything not listed was removed before insertion.

### What Was Happening
* Upload UI **parsed every column correctly** and built full objects.
* Repository layer **stripped unknown keys** → database received partial rows.
* Insights panel therefore showed blanks for timeline, geography, etc.

## 2 ▪ Columns Previously Missed & How They Were Restored
| Column | DB Presence | Status Before | Fix Applied |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| `timeline_period` | ✅ | dropped | added to `knownFields` |
| `historical_context` | ✅ | dropped | added |
| `geographic_location` | ✅ | dropped | added |
| `key_scripture_references` | ✅ | dropped | added |
| `theological_significance` | ✅ | dropped | added |
| `study_questions` | ✅ | dropped | added |
| `scriptural_context` | ✅ | sometimes parsed, then dropped | added |
| (future) `key_events`, `character_traits` | ✅ (array/json) | dropped | whitelisted for forward-compat |

The `knownFields` array in `src/repositories/characterRepository.js` now lists every column that exists in the **characters** table, so the repository no longer discards them.

## 3 ▪ Verification / Test Methodology
1. **Unit-like Script (`test_csv_import.js`)**  
   • Parsed a one-row CSV (`test_fix_import.csv`) containing every field.  
   • Called `bulkCreateCharacters()` and then fetched the row by `name`.  
   • Compared 16 key fields → all **✅ MATCH**.
2. **Database Diagnostics**  
   • Ran `check_characters.js` to ensure newly-imported character appears and fields hold expected values.  
3. **Manual UI Check**  
   • Launched app (`./run-app.sh`) → Admin → Insights panel now displays populated sections.

## 4 ▪ Outstanding Issues (Section 8 of Handoff)

| # | Issue | Current Status |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Supabase RLS hardening | **Open** – permissive RLS still in place |
| 2 | Offline→Online sync | **Open** – localStorage merge not implemented |
| 3 | Bundle size > 500 kB | **Open** – warning still logs; no code-split yet |
| 4 | Stripe checkout webhooks | **Open** – Edge function not created |
| 5 | Group chat engine | **Open** – only feasibility doc |
| 6 | Accessibility & SEO audit | **Open** |
| 7 | Tests & monitoring (Jest, Sentry) | **Open** |

_No additional outstanding items were closed in this session._

### Quick Notes
* Current work focused solely on **data-integrity**; no UI/UX or backend architecture changes were attempted beyond the CSV path.
* The enlarged whitelist in the repository is forward-compatible with future schema extensions.

## 🐛 Bug Fix – CSV Import

### Root Causes
1. **Parser limitations** – original implementation used simple `split(',')`.
2. **Field whitelist too short** – Character Insights fields dropped on insert.

### Resolution
* Introduced `parseCSV()` utility.
* Replaced line-level `split` logic with state machine parser.
* Extended `knownFields` to include:
  ```
  timeline_period, historical_context, geographic_location,
  key_scripture_references, theological_significance,
  relationships, study_questions
  ```
* Added dev-console group logging for easier diagnostics.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Select All & Bulk Delete
* Header checkbox selects / deselects all **filtered** rows.
* State maintained in `selectedCharacters`.
* “Delete Selected (N)” button with safety confirmation.
* Rows visually tinted when selected.

### 2. CSV Export
* Exports **every** character in the table (post-filter or all).
* Columns ordered to round-trip with importer.
* Values safely escaped, object fields JSON-stringified.
* Filename pattern: `bible-characters-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`.

# Bible Character Chat

A web experience that lets users **chat with biblical figures** such as Jesus, Mary, Moses, Paul, and many more.  
It blends a rich character-selection UI with an AI-powered chat and an ‚Äúinsights‚Äù side-panel that surfaces scripture, historical context, relationships, and study questions.

## üèóÔ∏è Accessing the React App (experimental)

> The React build currently fails; use only if you plan to help fix TS errors.

```
# install deps
npm install
# start with auth bypass & force-serve React (IGNORE legacy html)
./start-app.sh --skip-auth --force-react --port=5175
# open http://localhost:5175
```

If the screen is blank check browser console for TypeScript stack traces.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

1. **TypeScript build errors** in `CharacterCard.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`, several page components.  
2. **Legacy service-workers** may still trigger redirects; run `public/service-worker-cleanup.js` or clear site data.  
3. **Stripe integration** is mocked; attempting to purchase will no-op.  
4. **AI responses** in standalone mode are **rule-based placeholders**, not actual OpenAI calls.  
5. **Mobile viewport** needs polishing‚Äîalpha navigation overlaps on very small screens.  

---

## üîÆ Future Plans

1. **Fix TS & restore full React build** (replace curly quotes, close JSX tags, run `npm run lint`).  
2. **Port standalone logic into React components** (`ScalableCharacterSelection`, `ChatPage`) for single-page delivery.  
3. **Wire genuine OpenAI streaming** (with env var `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`) and real Stripe checkout.  
4. **Add Pastor/Admin dashboards** for content moderation & subscription management.  
5. **Progressive-Web-App polish** ‚Äì unified, clean service-worker, offline scripture cache.  
6. **Automated tests** (Playwright): select character ‚Üí send message ‚Üí expect response chip.  
7. **Multilingual support** starting with Spanish & Portuguese character bios.
